# Password Manager

I dont like the online systems, never use it.

In case you still use the Roboform desktop edition export the existing logins by using the [following](https://www.pipiscrew.com/2015/08/app-roboform-to-keepass/) method.

Import to [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/).

**KeePassXC vs KeePass**

Is a community-developed open-source fork of KeePass, one of the best password managers for Windows. KeePassXC differs from KeePass because it works on Linux, Mac, and Windows, but it also lacks some of the original software's features, such as plug-in support.

Then install the **KeePassXC-Browser addon** for [firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keepassxc-browser/) or [chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keepassxc-browser/oboonakemofpalcgghocfoadofidjkkk).

The browser addons on [github](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc-browser).

WARNING the browser addon from github repository, has different signature by the one is on the marketplace… Possible when use the one by repository you have to download also the [KeePassXC](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc) from the repository(?).. otherwise user getting something like “cant connect” error.
