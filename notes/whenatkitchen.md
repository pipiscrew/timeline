## frying pan

**Stainless steel** is `non-reactive` and easy to clean, while **cast iron** and **ceramic** can **add** iron and other minerals to food during cooking. However, it is important to note that **non-stick pans**, which are made from materials such as **Teflon**, may release **harmful** chemicals when heated to high temperatures.  

**Titanium** is `non-reactive`, meaning they won't affect the taste or quality of food, truly non-stick and they are also resistant to scratches and dings. Is typically **very safe**, especially when compared to other non-stick cookware sets that contain [Teflon](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/is-teflon-coating-safe), PTFE and other kinds of fluoropolymers.

* **Stainless steel** and **aluminum** frying pans can heat up to around 260-290°C when used on a gas stove.  
* **Cast iron** around 370-425°C on a gas stove.  
* Electric stove, usually get lower temperature than gas stove. 
* **Granite stone** (aka crushed stone or mineral-enriched) frying pans marketed as being healthier but contain trace amounts of heavy metals, which are harmful.

## krups suggestion
**​Arabica** coffee offers the best taste and is naturally low in caffeine. Experiment with different types, mixtures, and degrees of roasting to find what works best for you. In general, the darker the roasting, the more pronounced the taste of coffee. Delicate roasting gives a rich aroma, and the result is a delicate coffee with a full flavor-for true connoisseurs! Quality coffee should only be roasted gently so that its true richness, softness and completeness stand out. **Avoid** too **dark** roasted grains, they are more **oily** and can **clog** the device. Check that there are no small stones between the grains that could damage the device at the same time. Never use instant or ground coffee.

> In order to brew a **good** espresso, it is important to make sure that the **handle** (also known as the portafilter) **is full**. This means that the handle should be filled with the right amount of ground coffee, and the coffee should be evenly distributed and tamped down before brewing.  

### coffee not good ?
* use [burr grinder](https://www.homegrounds.co/coffee-grind-chart/) (not blade grinder) [sample](https://coffeetechniciansguild.org/blog/2018/8/14/selecting-a-burr-type-for-an-espresso-grinder)
* [5 Things To Try](https://www.javapresse.com/blogs/espresso/espresso-troubleshooting-5-things-to-try)
  * Is it bitter and dull (over extracted)?
  * Is it acidic and sour (under extracted)?
* [why it never tastes as good](https://www.threellamascoffee.com/blogs/news/home-espresso-coffee-why-it-never-tastes-as-good-as-an-espresso-from-your-cafe)
  * The extraction should finish at approx 25 - 30 seconds for a double shot basket.
    * Coffee running TOO FAST (less than 20 seconds) = make the grind finer
      * if your shot pulls too fast it tastes under extracted.
    * Coffee running TOO SLOW (more than 35 seconds) = make the grind coarser  
      *  if your shot pulls too slowly it tastes over extracted.  

###  blade grinder bug  
The small-sized coffee ground particles – called “fines” – will **over extract** some of the chemical compounds that cause **bitterness**, while the larger sized particles may remain **under extracted**.  [source](https://foodal.com/drinks-2/coffee/grinders/why-you-shouldnt-use-a-blade-grinder-for-your-coffee/)  [[instead buy burr grinder](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B09W9N1ZWV/)]  


Extraction always happens like this:  

1. The first things to be extracted are bright, sour, flavorful acids
2. Next come the aromatic oils, sugars, and most flavors
3. Lastly come the lower notes and bitter tannins  

Perfectly extracted espresso is flavorful, aromatic, and has a pleasant balance of bright acids and deeper bitter notes. It should taste like a symphony of flavors in harmony. This happens by extracting just the right amount of solids, oils, acids, and other things from the grounds.

## Nappuccino
Have a cup of coffee just before you doze off post lunch. Caffeine, a stimulant, takes about **twenty minutes** to enter your **bloodstream**, so if you have a cup of coffee, set your alarm for twenty minutes and then take a nap. You'll wake up refreshed and ready to go.

This technique is called nappuccino. This is why several companies have nap rooms or nap pods where employees can take a quick nap. It helps overcome the slump in their days. [source](https://bip.so/@TIL_/Nappucino-iZTgy)
