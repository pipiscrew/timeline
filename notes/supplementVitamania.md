If you **extract sugars** from **corn syrup**. **Ferment** them with **bacteria** and add a **chemical reaction,** you have synthetic **vitamin C**. Most synthetic vitamins are chemically identical to the natural form, but without the **fiber** and **micronutrients** that come with food. The end result is a vitamin made not **by a plant**, but **in a plant**.

Given the amount of vitamin needed is generally tiny, what makes up the rest of the pill? Well, inactive materials like **cellulose, sugars, or rice flour** are often added to provide bulk and to **help the tablets dissolve in the gut**. **Colors** and **flavors** can also be added to make the tablets more **palatable**.

Around half the countries on Earth allow the **addition** of **synthetic vitamins** to common **food products**. It's called **fortification**. In places like the US and Australia, fortifying bread flour and margarine is required by law. And companies often decide to add vitamins, mostly from the **B family**. The B vitamins are sometimes called the pep vitamins, they help our bodies produce energy and assist in cell development. One of the vitamins added to bread is **B9**, better known as **folate**, to avoid neural tube defect.

**Neural tube defects** can be caused by the lack of **folate** long before birth. If you eat folate, it's the best kind of diet because it's actually found richly in leafy green **vegetables**, it's found in things like **asparagus**, it's found in **strawberries**, it's found in **whole grains**, so if you are eating fruits and vegetables, it's quite likely that you will have a diet rich in folate. **Folate is very important for both DNA and RNA repair**, but also for the rapid** development and multiplication of cells** which is what's happening in the fetus, so it's essential for that.

### Vitamin D

**Low vitamin D** has been linked to cancer, heart disease, dementia, it's been linked to over 100 different conditions. There are some who claim we're in a **midst** of a global vitamin D **deficiency**.

When sunlight **hits our skin**, something remarkable happens. Just under the surface lies a type of **cholesterol**. When the sun's **ultraviolet rays** hit this **molecule**, it **transforms**, becoming a form of **vitamin D**. This is the **same** molecule found in **cod liver oil**. It then **travels** to the **liver**, where it's converted into the form that doctors **measure** in our **blood**. This is then activated by the **kidneys**, and now, it's ready to **help absorb** calcium, building strong, healthy, rickets free bones. Today, most of the world's vitamin **D pills** are **created** from the greasy **wool of sheep, **mostly Australian sheep. The wool is coated in a type of grease or **lanolin**, it's the stuff that makes your hands feel soft. It's a **mixture** of **fatty acids** produced by the **sheep's oil glands**, and this lanolin is the **key** to making **synthetic vitamin D**. The **lanolin** is separated from the wool by boiling in hot water and detergent. Around **15 percent** of the **lanolin** is a form of **cholesterol**, **like** the cholesterol under our **skin**. This is a extracted and oxidized to produce a new compound which is then irradiated with ultraviolet light, transforming it into a precursor of vitamin D. **This chemical process mimics** the **biological process** of the s**unlight hitting our skin**. Several more steps create the end product, synthetic vitamin D. Vitamin D's not just a vitamin, vitamin D is a **hormone** that has a range of **incredibly powerful effects** on the cells in our body that could determine whether or not that cell starts to divide uncontrollably and become a cancer for example or whether or not that cell gets a mutation and kills itself.

Geneticist professor **Tim Spector** studied **vitamin D** a lot **in the last 15 years** were the first group to show that the levels in individuals is actually **partly controlled by your genes** so we always assume it's purely how much sunshine you get or how much oily fish you're eating but in fact, about **50 percent of the levels vary just because the genes you've** got and so **everyone has a different normal** level of their vitamins and that is generally holding true for all the vitamins we've been able to test so far so our idea of normal should actually be very person specific.

The **13 vitamins** can be divided into two teams, the **water soluble** team consisting   

-all the B vitamins  
-vitamin C  
  
and the **fat soluble** team, consisting  

-Vitamin A  
-Vitamin D  
-Vitamin E  
-Vitamin K  

We can **get rid of excess water soluble** vitamins in our **urine**, but the **fat soluble** ones are **stored** in our **livers** and **fatty tissue**, so they're the ones that can build up **easily to toxic** levels.

In **1994**, a new **US** law is passed, **forbidding** the testing of dietary supplements for safety or effectiveness before sale. We lobbied on behalf of the dietary supplement industry to get congress to pass a sweeping law in 1994 that forever forbade the FDA from requiring that dietary supplements be tested or for efficacy before they're sold. Different countries have different regulations. In **Australia**, most vitamin products are classified as complimentary medicines. Manufacturers must certify that they use low risk ingredients, products contain what they say they contain and they have evidence to back up health claims. In **Europe**, vitamin products are regulated as food supplements and again, they **don't have to be tested** before they go on sale.
