## What About Cooking In Anodized Aluminum?
Aluminum cookware that has been anodized (hardened through a process that renders it `non-reactive`) or clad in a nonreactive material, such as stainless steel or a nonstick coating, does not leach into or react with foods.  

There are two main types of espresso water boilers:
* [Thermocoil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=379YtdIRpRU) boilers
* Heat Exchanger boilers

**Aluminum** boilers can be found in both **Thermocoil** boilers and **Heat Exchanger** boilers. It depends on the specific design and construction of the espresso machine.

**Heat Exchanger** boilers are generally considered to be **less** expensive than Thermocoil boilers. This is because Heat Exchanger boilers are simpler in design and have fewer components, making them easier and less expensive to manufacture. However, the price can also depend on other factors such as the brand, size, and features of the espresso machine.

There is a concern that aluminum can **leach** into water from aluminum heat exchanger boilers in espresso machines. However, the amount of aluminum leached into the water is typically low and **considered** safe by most health organizations. The aluminum used in these boilers is also usually **coated** or treated to **reduce** the risk of leaching.  

A **TDS** (total dissolved solids) meter can be used to measure the amount of aluminum (as well as other minerals) in the water brewed from an espresso machine. It is important to note that TDS meters **measure** total dissolved solids, not just aluminum, so the results should be interpreted in conjunction with other information and tests.  

**Nespresso** espresso machines typically use a **Thermoblock** heating system, rather than a traditional boiler. The Thermoblock system heats water on demand and delivers it directly to the brewing unit, where it is mixed with the coffee grounds to produce the espresso. This type of system allows for rapid heating and brewing, and is a common design feature in many compact and home espresso machines, including some models from Nespresso.  

The heating element in Nespresso's Thermoblock system is usually made of **aluminum**. The aluminum rapidly heats the water as it passes through the heating element, allowing the machine to produce espresso quickly and efficiently. The aluminum material is carefully selected and **treated** to reduce the risk of leaching into the water.  

Nespresso Thermoblock heating system typically uses **anodized aluminum**. Anodization is a process that creates a protective oxide layer on the surface of aluminum, which can help to **reduce** the risk of leaching and increase the durability and lifespan of the material. By using anodized aluminum in its Thermoblock systems, Nespresso aims to ensure that its espresso machines are able to produce high-quality espresso while also maintaining the safety of the water and the longevity of the machine.
