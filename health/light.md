Sunlight is powerful stuff, perhaps more **powerful** than most people realise. Every aspect of how we function is // by light. In winter we are seeing a lot less sunlight. The perils of living without sunlight are really quite real. In some ways, modern life has driven us back to the Stone Age, when we lived in caves.  

In the 60s there were several **experiments** by French people who went into caves and stayed there. They all began to sleep either for extraordinarily long periods of time or extraordinarily short periods of time, and they couldn't tell the difference. They all said they had severe mood **disturbances** and depression, so much so that some of them had to leave long before they really had planned to. 

In winter, we often feel somewhat out of sorts at this time of the year. A lack of sunlight means that your immune system **doesn't work as well**, your defense mechanisms **don't work as well**. An effect on mood, increased depression, more metabolic **disorders**, and all of these things are offshoots of a **disrupted** circadian clock. It times all of our physiology and all of our behavior. All of the active sorts of processes are compartmentalized to the day, and all of the **restorative** processes are kept to the **night**.  

The wavelengths that have the most powerful impact are the bluish-coloured ones. Within our eyes there are these cells that have a pigment that's sensitive to this blue light, that **signals** to the body clock to tell it what time of day it is. Your systems within your body tend to **desynchronize** and so you tend to have a higher incidence of diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease.  

The World Health Organization sees **shift work** as a threat to health, and it is. Many British people spend less than half an hour a day in the **open air**. So it's no good staying inside and looking at the Sun and saying this is doing me good, because it isn't.  

A good dose of bright sunshine at any time during the day has a **huge impact** on elevating mood and general feelings of wellbeing. There was a study at the Broadmoor institute where they looked at the effects of the equivalent of 20 minutes of bright sunshine in the morning on mood. What they found was the bright light had a much greater effect on elevating mood than even some anti-depressants. 

So our **skin** not just a barrier, it's a living **organ**. When our skin sees sunlight, that is when it **starts** making **vitamin D**, which is an essential component of many different signaling pathways in our body. If we're not getting outside, and this is going to have an impact on how well the body clock is **aligned**. It makes us even more like hermits in a cave relying on artificial light. Have meals at the **right time**, go to bed at the **right time**, and get out, even if it's freezing, for that daily **20-minute walk** and some light exposure. Simply being outside and exposing yourself to light, so that you strengthen your **circadian clock** is going to have a hugely beneficial impact on health and wellbeing. Don't retreat into your cave. In other words, when the sun comes out, go out and have a good time, that's the medical advice.

* Must by [LED](https://www.pipiscrew.com/threads/bulbs.50615/)
* Must be type `warm blue`

**Fluorescent lamps** are generally recognized as safe, for some people, exposure to fluorescent light appears to **elicit** an elevated **stress** response.

With CFLs (compact fluorescent light bulbs) as your main light source **day in** and **day out**, this could increase your risk for **migraines** and **eye strain**. [source](https://www.healthline.com/health/natural-light-benefits)
