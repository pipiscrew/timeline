**Propolis** and its **flavonoids** have been widely **used** in folk medicine **as anti-inflammatory agents**, and as ingredients in anti-fungal antibiotics, anti-coagulants, anti-retrovirals, anti- allergic and anti-cancer drugs. Propolis **protects** the **skin** from numerous processes, such as **premature aging** (wrinkles, scaling, dryness, dilatation of blood vessels, and loss of collagen) and skin cancer. Propolis contains a large number of compounds that **accelerate skin healing** processes, such as tensile strength and elasticity, and enables growth, expansion, and migration of human keratinocytes. These properties and biochemical changes in propolis could favor re-epithelization and thus represent promising effects in wound healing.    

**IgE**\-mediated inﬂammatory reactions are directed towards **foreign molecules** called **allergens**. According to new research, dietary factors, especially the amount and quality of dietary fat intake (key components of a typical Western diet), signiﬁcantly contribute to allergic sensitization. The hygiene hypothesis clearly shows the importance of the Th1/Th2 (cells) relationship; insufﬁcient exposure to microbes and reduced Th1 response leads to an **increase** in the prevalence of atopic sensitization and clinical diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, and **eczema**.    

The term **sensitivity** is general and may include **true** allergies, reactions that **do not affect** the immune system (and therefore are not technically allergies), and reactions for which the cause has yet to be determined.    

Certain non-allergic types of sensitivity are called intolerances and may be caused by toxins, enzyme inadequacies, drug-like chemical reactions, psychological associations, and reactions to chemicals found in :  

*   food    
*   water    
*   medications    
*   cosmetics    
*   perfumes    
*   textiles    
*   building materials    
*   plastics    

There are **immune-mediated** and **non-immune mediated** reactions among adverse reactions to food. **Immune-mediated reactions** to food are **mediated either by IgE antibodies** or other immunological pathways, whereas food intolerance causes the formation of antibodies against proteins in a certain type of food. IgE antibodies, which would indicate an allergic process, are not formed. IgA antibodies are formed in the ﬁrst phase, and after multiple stimulations, IgG antibodies are formed. Food intolerances also comprise non- immunologic-mediated responses that depend on enzyme deﬁciencies, pharmacological reactions or arise by unknown mechanisms.    

In the USA, 32 million Americans have food allergies, and relevant studies, published in 2018 and 2019, estimated that the number of Americans of all ages who had allergic symptoms to a certain food were:  

*   8.2 million: milk    
*   6.1 million: peanuts    
*   6.1 million: tree nuts    
*   3.9 million: eggs    
*   2.6 million: ﬁsh    
*   2.6 million: wheat foods    
*   1.9 million: soy  

In developed countries, IgE-associated food allergies affect 3–8% of children and 1–3% of adults. Food allergies have increased worldwide **from** about **3%** of the population in **1960** to about **7%** in **2018**. Approximately 7.6% of children in the USA are thought to have food allergies, and 40% of them have multiple food allergies. The food we eat daily can have both **allergy-promoting** and **anti-allergic** nutrients, which indicates the possibility of allergy control through food selection. For example  

*   certain vitamins (A, C, D and E)
*   minerals (selenium, copper, zinc and magnesium)
*   probiotics and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids+ (PUFAs)
*   polyphenols

have been **shown** to possess **anti-allergic properties**, whereas **omega-6 PUFAs** are precursors for leukotriene C4, which is known to **promote** **allergic inﬂammation**.   

Food allergens induce the production of **IgE antibodies** that have the ability to **bind** to the **surface** of **mast cells** and **basophils** distributed **throughout** the body, stimulating their **degranulation** (release of histamine from basophils and mast cells). which **cause** an allergic response in a **sensitive** person within a few minutes or, at most, a few hours. Chemically, food allergens are proteins or glycoproteins with molecular masses from ~10,000 to 70,000 daltons, and high stability to proteases and heat.  

Approximately **200 of** the **hundreds of thousands allergenic proteins** have been isolated from food and include :  

*   peanuts    
*   soybeans    
*   crustacea    
*   ﬁsh    
*   cow milk    
*   eggs    
*   tree nuts    
*   wheat  

According to Heﬂe these allergens **make 90%** of all reported food allergies **worldwide**. The number of people suffering from **IgE-mediated** allergic diseases is constantly increasing and reached the **6th leading cause** of diseases in the US. Although the number of Americans with allergies is around 40–50 million according to the National Institute of Health, it is believed that a large number of people have not been diagnosed yet. The overall prevalence of certain allergies, such as asthma, allergic rhinitis and atopic eczema, are **increasing substantially**.  

According to the World Health Organization, the number of patients who have **asthma** is about 300 million, and it is expected to increase to 400 million by 2025. Similarly, allergic **rhinitis** occurs in more than 500 million people worldwide and also is constantly increasing. the **intake** of **probiotics** can increase the **effectiveness** in **reducing** eczema by 21%.  

Intake of **antioxidants** in diets, such as polyphenols (ﬂavonoids, vitamin C, vitamin E and selenium coming mainly from fruit and vegetables), may have a **protective** effect.  Furthermore, different **fats** found in :  

*   milk    
*   butter    
*   vegetable oils    
*   ﬁsh  

**may have different** effects on the development of **allergies** and asthma.    

Recent research points to a central role of the **microbiome**, which is highly inﬂuenced by multiple environmental and dietary factors. It was found that **extensive** changes in the environment and nutrition **produce** **dysbiosis** in the gut, skin and lung microbiome, inducing qualitative and quantitative changes in their composition and metabolic activity.  

Dysbiosis induces qualitative and quantitative changes in the microbiota that directly affect immunological mechanisms **leading** to allergic diseases. The **role** of probiotics and prebiotics in the diet is **promising**. Therefore, it seems that the microbiota is a **very dynamic environment**, inﬂuenced by multiple environmental and nutritional factors, with a **complex role** in allergic diseases.  

Raw propolis contains 45.02–58.72% of dietary ﬁber and a signiﬁcant amount of :  

*   sodium    
*   potassium    
*   copper    
*   zinc    
*   iron    
*   calcium    
*   potassium    
*   phosphorus    
*   manganese    
*   magnesium    
*   pyridoxine    
*   folic acid  

which indicates that it can be used as food **with a positive effect** on intestinal **microbiota**.  Foods rich in ﬁber and antioxidants, such as polyphenolic constituents of plants and bee products including propolis, stimulate the activity and formation of “good bacteria”, reducing and acting as a bactericidal on pathogenic bacteria; and can reduce and prevent numerous allergic reactions. The biﬁdogenic effect of bee products has been known for a long time and can be useful in **treating allergic** reactions.
