Type : Anaerobic  

Three days per week, [those](https://vimeo.com/showcase/8220991) target the whole body.  

## sprint

Type : Anaerobic  

Between 2 street lights for example. You **sprint** as much you can in one direction and then **walk back**... Time to **rest** is time to go **back**... This will **help** your **heart** immensely...  

So original is **20 seconds** sprint, **10 seconds** walk, for 10 **rounds**...

But because cant do it from the beginning, you **start** with **10 seconds sprint** and **20 seconds walk**, slowly increase the distance until you get the needed **20 second sprint** and 10 (or 20) **walk**....

Rounds are always 10. Avoid sprinting on asphalt / concrete.


There are generally three different sprint distances:  

* 100m  
* 200m
* 400m  

In an original Olympic event was a sprint of around 180m.
