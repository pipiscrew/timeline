## sprint

Type : Anaerobic  

Between 2 street lights for example. You **sprint** as much you can in one direction and then **walk back**... Time to **rest** is time to go **back**... This will **help** your **heart** immensely...  

So original is **20 seconds** sprint, **10 seconds** walk, for 10 **rounds**...

But because cant do it from the beginning, you **start** with **10 seconds sprint** and **20 seconds walk**, slowly increase the distance until you get the needed **20 second sprint** and 10 (or 20) **walk**....

Rounds are always 10. Avoid sprinting on asphalt / concrete.


There are generally three different sprint distances:  

* 100m  
* 200m
* 400m  

In an original Olympic event was a sprint of around 180m.

Why Morning Exercise Sets You Up for Success
--------------------------------------------------------
When you **elevate your heart rate** through exercise, it **increases blood flow** throughout the **body**. Your blood among other things **carries oxygen and glucose**. Oxygen and glucose are **fundamental** fuel components for most of the chemical reactions in our body. The **brain** uses **glucose** for fuel and accounts for about 20% of our daily glucose consumption, which is impressive given that the brain makes up only about 2% of our bodyweight.

Increased blood flow increases oxygen delivery, which is one of the reasons you feel **clear headed after exercise**. Short story, exercise increases the **delivery** of **key nutrients** to the brain. But that isn’t the interesting part, because when you finish exercising the increased blood flow will start to decline as your heart rate returns to its baseline. The fascinating and awesome thing is what happens after you exercise.

**Executive Function** is a term used by psychologists and some neuroscientists to describe **our ability to engage in goal-directed behavior**. It can be thought of as the collection of processes in your brain that **act as “CEO”** of your brain. Specifically, it covers our ability to manage and control the following things (technical terms in parentheses):

* Sustained attention (Selective Attention)
* Moving from one task to the next (Task Switching)
* Managing our impulses (Inhibitory Control)
* Holding information in our mind that we need to solve problems or complete tasks (Working Memory)
* Planning and execution
* Adaptation to new information or unfamiliar situations

**Executive function** is a big deal. When it functions well you’re **better** able to make choices that align with your goals, **focus** on what’s important to you, hold your tongue when your significant other says something that upsets you, **learn** new information, and **solve** problems.

When you exercise your brain both elevates and balances the levels of the **neurotransmitters** dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. All three are **highly involved** in **executive function** because of their action as **regulators** of important **signaling processes** in the brain.  

**Dopamine** is involved in learning, attention, and our reward system, which helps us associate goal-oriented behavior with satisfaction.  

**Norepinephrine** influences attention, perception, motivation, and arousal (the technical term for being alert and able to respond).  

**Serotonin** influences mood, impulsivity, anger, and aggressiveness with research pointing to it as a regulator of mental activity that gets out of balance. That means serotonin can help prevent something like depression from spiraling out-of-control.

The key is that **physical** exercise elevates and balances the levels of the neurotransmitters associated with executive function. Many of the drugs psychiatrists **prescribe** work by addressing neurotransmitter levels that are either high or low. **Zoloft**, for instance, increases synaptic levels of serotonin, while **Adderall** increases levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine (adrenaline). The brain is a **highly interdependent system** and **when** neurotransmitter levels are **out-of-balance** cognitive function can be impaired and mood disorders can **occur**. In fact, many of the side effects from drugs **prescribed** by psychiatrists occur because in the process of elevating or suppressing a specific neurotransmitter the **overall balance** in the brain **isn’t** quite where it needs to be.

> Dr. John J. Ratey said : I tell people that going for a run is like taking a little bit of Prozac and a little bit of Ritalin because, like the drugs, exercise elevates the neurotransmitters.

Students that **exercise before** school **perform better** in school.

Exercise also **increases** the production of a protein called brain-derived neurotrophic factor (**BDNF**). The human brain has over **85 billion neurons**, which along with glia are the cells that compose the brain. Neurons receive information from the environment, communicate changes to other neurons through electrical and chemical signals and control the body’s responses to the environment. Neurons are the “thinking” portion of the brain.

**BDNF** improves the function of neurons, encourages the growth of neurons, and protects existing neurons from cell death.

# Cardiorespiratory fitness

> **HIIT** (High-Intensity Interval Training)  
> **RT** (Resistance Training)  
> **MICT** (Moderate-Intensity Continuous Training)  
> **IT** (Interval Training) - alternates between periods of high-intensity exercise and periods of lower-intensity exercise.  
> **SIT** (Sprint Interval Training)  
> **CRT** (Circular Resistance Training)  
> **CRF** (Cardiorespiratory Fitness)  

Cardiorespiratory fitness CRF **refers** to the capacity of the circulatory and respiratory systems to supply oxygen to skeletal muscle **<span style="color: rgb(226, 80, 65)">mitochondria</span>** for **energy production** needed during physical activity. It is an **intermediate variable** between physical activity behavior and health outcomes and **reflects** the ability of many body organs (such as heart, lungs, and muscles) to generate **energy** during physical activity and exercise.  

The current physical activity **guidelines** recommend that all adults engage in at least **150 min** of <u>moderate-intensity</u> exercise or **75 min** of <u>vigorous-intensity</u> exercise **per week**. To improve CRF, current evidence suggests that physical exercise must achieve a minimum intensity of at least 45% of the oxygen absorption reserve in the general population and at least 70–80% in athletes.  

**HIIT** has been promoted as a **superior**, <u>time-saving exercise</u> strategy to enhance CRF in the **middle-aged (ages 45-59 years)**. A systematic review of evidence suggested that both interval training and MICT could significantly improve CRF in middle-aged and elderly people; however, MICT has no significant effect on improving VO2max (maximum amount of oxygen your body can utilize during intense exercise) in middle-aged compared with HIIT and sprint interval training. However, **HIIT is still the preferred training method**.  

> **ANS** (Autonomic Nervous System)  
> **HRV** (Heart Rate Variability)  
> **HR** (Heart Rate)  
> **PA** (Physical Activity)  
> **PR** (Pulmonary Rehabilitation)  

Cardiovascular function is **regulated** by the ANS. The main objective of autonomic cardiovascular regulation is to control cardiac output and the **distribution** of blood at the central and peripheral levels. HR and the contractile properties of the myocardium, are modulated by the main components of ANS: the **<span style="color: rgb(226, 80, 65)">parasympathetic</span>** and **<span style="color: rgb(226, 80, 65)">sympathetic</span>** nervous systems. The activity of these two **ANS branches** with <u>opposite effects</u> on HR causes continuous fluctuations in HR, which is called HRV.  

Under normal conditions, the **conduction process** begins in a particular area of the heart, named the **atrial sinus node**, whose **<span style="color: rgb(226, 80, 65)">electrical properties</span>** can generate the action potential that spreads quickly through specialized **fibres to the heart**, resulting in **contraction** of the **entire cardiac muscle**. In addition to this intrinsic mechanism that determines the basal cardiac rhythm, the ANS plays an important role in controlling the **heart function** and **vascular system** through the **<span style="color: rgb(226, 80, 65)">sympathetic </span>** and **<span style="color: rgb(226, 80, 65)">parasympathetic </span>fibres to the heart**, and through the <span style="color: rgb(226, 80, 65)">**sympathetic fibres**</span> to the **vessels**. The **two branches** of the ANS, i.e., the sympathetic and parasympathetic fibres, act in an <u>opposite way</u>, providing **fine adjustment** to the cardiac tissues **in response** to different stimuli and daily activities. However, an **imbalance** between **<span style="color: rgb(226, 80, 65)">sympathetic </span>** and **<span style="color: rgb(226, 80, 65)">parasympathetic </span>** drives has been proposed as a potential mechanism in some cardiovascular diseases such as arterial hypertension, heart failure, and myocardial infarction.
