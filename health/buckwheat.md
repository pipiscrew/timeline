Analysis **common buckwheat** (aka F. esculentum) flour produced in Latvia :  
* lysine (6.07 g/100 g protein) *excellent source of essential amino acids, especially lysine*
* resistant starch (23.42% DW)
* dietary fibre (16.86 g/100 g of DW)
* iron (3.2 mg/100 g of DW)
* zinc (2.7 mg/100 g of DW)
* phenols (total phenolic content – 132.85 GAE mg 100 g DW) 
* rutin – 16.38 mg/100 g DW
* quercetin – 3.84 mg/100 g DW
* vitexin – 1.44 mg/100 g DW 
* epicatechin – 39.13 mg/100 g DW
* with radical scavenging activity (DPPH – 94.76 ± 0.48%) (aka neutralize free radicals)  

> DW stands for "dry weight.". When you see "23.42% DW," it means that 23.42% of the dry weight of the food ingredient is made up of resistant starch.  

## Nutritional point of view

Buckwheat **protein** is well balanced when it comes to the amino acids composition especially being **rich** in  
* lysine
* arginine  

Buckwheat has relatively **high dietary fiber**, **vitamins** and **flavonoid** content, mainly :  
* orientin
* vitexin
* isoorientin
* quercitin
* rutin  

Buckwheat contains important nutrients including **polyunsaturated** essential fatty acids, **minerals** such as :  
* Mg (magnesium)
* K (potassium)
* Fe (iron)  

and vitamins (B, C, and E). The above mentioned aspects rendered the buckwheat various health benefits. In particular, buckwheat can be a major ingredient of **gluten free** food products for people with **celiac** disease. Also, the demand for **rutin** and other flavonoids extracted from buckwheat is growing in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries due to their desirable physiological activities, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antihypertensive.  

The buckwheat diet **decreased** the level of **cholesterol** in the serum by enhancing the removal through feces, **ameliorated** the **diabetes** by inhibiting the absorption of sugars and improved the **growth** of the `beneficial intestinal bacteria`.  

In addition to its ability to reduce hemorrhage in people with **high blood pressure**, `rutin` has several other medicinal properties including pharmacological, vasconstrictive, spasmolitic and positive inotropic effects. Therefore, recent researches demonstrated that buckwheat may act as a **prebiotic**, thus encouraging the **growth** of probiotics or friendly bacteria in the digestive tract.  

Various functional food products have been developed from buckwheat such as: vinegar, beer, whisky, tea and different functional fermented beverages, bread, steamed bread, breakfast cereals, porridge, soup, noodles, pasta, pancakes, biscuits and cookies. The majority of these buckwheat products are commercially available on the limited-size niche markets. In order to develop **new functional foods**, buckwheat could be **fermented** by different types of microorganisms, as following: 
* lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus rhamnosus, L. acidophilus, L. casei, L. plantarum, L. salivarius etc.)
* moulds (Rhizopus oligosporus, Aspergillus oryzae, A. niger)
* mushrooms (Cordyceps militaris, Pleurotus eryngii, Agaricus spp.)
* yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)  

In these fermentation processes buckwheat could play a role as a nutrient for the **microorganism growth** and could also **stimulate** the metabolic activity and viability preservation during processing and during shelf life period in order to **maintain** the functional properties.  

>  Addition of buckwheat flour in bread can provide the reduction of glycemic response by about 23% (Liu et al., 2017)  

> reported on prebiotic effect of buckwheat flour on Lactobacillus acidophilus in fermented milk (Vasile et al., 2016)  

>  indicated that buckwheat diet decreased mesophilic bacteria and increased lactic acid bacteria in the rat intestine demonstrating the prebiotic properties of buckwheat (Prestamo et al., 2003)  

Due to its technological properties and specific flavour, buckwheat flour **cannot substitute** wheat flour in bakery products for 100%. (Filipcev et al., 2011; Psodorov et al., 2015; Wronkowska & Soral-Smietana, 2008)  

> researches showed that buckwheat protein can reduce the gallstone formation in hamsters by intake of buckwheat protein product and hypercholesterolemia in rats by intake of high protein buckwheat flour.  

In Latvian buckwheat flour the highest content of essential amino acids were compromised by **histidine** and **lysine**, similar results were obtained for **methionine** and **phenylalanine** comparing to **Slovenian** buckwheat flour. Among unessential amino acids the noticeable differences were observed for **arginine** and **proline**, where significantly **lower** content was determined for Latvian buckwheat flour. Comparing **Latvian** buckwheat flour with buckwheat **seeds from Poland** there were determined significant differences in content of **lysine** and **isoleucine** among essential amino acids and in content of **arginine**, **glutamic acid**, **proline** and **tyrosine** among essential amino acids. **Lysine** content of Latvian buckwheat flour was the **highest among unessential** amino acids and composed **18.26% of total essential amino acids**. 

> analysed proteins digestibility of buckwheat in vitro and concluded that protein digestibility of raw buckwheat was 82.69%.  (Wronkowska et al., 2015)  

> indicated that buckwheat had low lysine/arginine and methionine/arginine ratios were 0.94 and 0.22, respectively therefore, buckwheat flour could be characterized as blood cholesterol lowering product. (Biel & Maciorowski 2013)

The **major** component of buckwheat flour is **starch** which content in the literature ranges between 58.9 and 78.4% DW (Alvarez-Jubete et al., 2009; Bonafaccia et al., 2003b; Qin et al., 2010; Wronkowska et al., 2015). The **starch content** of Latvian buckwheat flour was 78.6% DW, which was close to Bonafaccia et al., (2003b) data. However, essential importance was determined in the content of `resistant starch` (RS) in buckwheat flour. RS is characterized as prebiotic, it is not digested in the small intestine and provides healthy intestinal microbiota (Gorecki et al., 2018; Sajilata et al., 2006). **Diverse data of RS content** in buckwheat flour were reported: Qin et al., (2010) concluded that common buckwheat flour of different cultivars showed **various content of RS** – 15.01-23.07% DW, where **RS content** of Latvian buckwheat flour was 23.42% DW.  

The technology process and storage conditions of product had an **influence** on RS content. Due to a high amount of RS in buckwheat flour it could be used for food production with low **GI properties** (Skrabanja et al., 2001). This was confirmed by Shen et al., (2016) results where glycaemic index of buckwheat starch and resistant starch was 53.96 ± 0.02 and 45.30 ± 0.01 respectively.  

The intake of **dietary fibre** has an essential importance on the human diet due to its health benefits: favourable effects on the digestive system and weight management, cholesterol lowering effect and reduction of glycaemic response etc. (Kendall et al., 2010; Mudgil & Barak, 2013). The content of total dietary fibre in buckwheat flour ranged between 3.8 ± 0.2 and 21.5 ± 1.2 g/100 g DW. The content of dietary fibre in Latvian buckwheat flour was mentioned in the data of literature. It could be concluded, that Latvian buckwheat flour is a **great source of dietary fibre**, where **insoluble/soluble** dietary fibre ratio is **5:1**. According to the EFSA recommendations 100 g of Latvian buckwheat flour can provide about **60% of daily dietary fibre intake**.

The **biological value** of product is determined by the content of vitamins, minerals and flavonoids etc. It is known that buckwheat is an excellent source of **bioactive compounds** which have a beneficial effects on the human health (Vollmannova et al., 2013). Bonafaccia et al., (2003b) indicated that common buckwheat flour contained` B group vitamins` such as thiamine – 0.28 mg/100 g -1 , riboflavin – 0.14 mg/100 g -1 and pyridoxine – 0.15 mg/100 g -1 . The data of current research presented a significantly higher content of B group vitamins comparing to results of Bonafaccia et al., (2003b), where thiamine was 1.05 ± 0.05 mg/100 g -1 and riboflavin – 1.16 ± 0.03 mg/100 g -1 . In the literature buckwheat is **characterized** as good source of micro and macro elements, i.e., zinc, iron, copper, potassium, calcium and magnesium (Ciesarova et al., 2016; Katar et al., 2016; Stibilj et al., 2004; Wei et al., 2003).

Buckwheat is a functional food with **anti-imflammatory** and **antioxidant** properties due to content of **phenolic** compounds (Holasova et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2012). Keriene et al., (2015) concluded that buckwheat had the **highest total phenolic** content and **antioxidant** activity among agricultural crops. Kiprovski et al., (2015) reported about **significant differences of phenolic acids**, **flavonoids** and **antioxidant** activity among common buckwheat cultivars.  

Total phenolic content of Latvian buckwheat flour **was lower to white** and dark buckwheat flour from the **USA**, whereas radical scavenging activity was higher according to the literature data. Mikulajova et al., (2016) reported about the **coherence** between **phenolic** content and **antioxidant** ability. The highest phenolic content provided the **best antioxidant** abilityy, but it has **not been confirmed** by the current research.  

In total, **26 phenolic compounds** were determined in Latvian buckwheat flour: catechin hydrate, chlorogenic acid, vanillin, vanillic acid, caffeic acid, epicatechin, syringic acid, p–coumaric acid, sinapic acid, 2– OHcinnamic acid, rutin, quercetin, vitexin, 2–hydroxy–3–O–b–D-glucopyranosyl–benzoic acid, caffeic acid hexose, swertiamacroside, flavonol–glycosides, catechin–glucosides, epicatechin gallate, (epi)af- zelchin–(epi) catechin isomer, epiafzelchin–epicatechin–O–methylgallate, (–)epicatechin–O–3.4-dimethyl–gallate, epiafzelchin–epicatechin–O– dimethylgallate, procyanidin B2–dimethylgallate, and epiafzelchin– epiafzelchin–epicatechin.  

According to the obtained results Latvian buckwheat flour was **essential source of flavonoids**. Zhang et al., (2012) reported on the six flavonoids content in buckwheat (rutin, quercetin, vitexin, isovitexin, orientin and isoorientin). Similar conclusions were expressed by Zielinska et al., (2012) pointing to the content of rutin, quercetin, orientin, vitexin and isovitexin in buckwheat. In the current research there were **not identified** such flavonoids as **orientin, isovitexin and isoorientin**, but there was detected **epicatechin** at a **high concentration** (39.13 ± 0.87 mg 100 g -1 DW) in buckwheat flour (association cognitive function, as well as improved blood flow). Similar conclusions were reported by Peng et al., (2004) – common buckwheat flour contained **greater epicatechin concentration** compared to buckwheat **hulls**.  

`Rutin` is the most widely mentioned buckwheat flavonoid in the literature, it has been **characterized** as the main **antioxidative** compound in buckwheat. Jiang et al., (2007) indicated a significant **correlation** between the rutin content and antioxidant activity. Rutin can **decrease** the high **blood pressure**, the absorption of dietary **cholesterol**, `inhibit lipoprotein oxidation` and suppress the glucotoxicity in rats (Cai & Lin, 2009; Jiang et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2012).  

The ratio of **rutin** and **quercetin** could be changed mixing buckwheat flour with water, the concentration of rutin significantly **decreased** while the concentration of quercetin **increased** over time, it could be explained with the enzymes activity **converting rutin to quercetin** and rutinose (Yoo et al., 2012).

> The buckwheat protein content mainly (80%) consisted of **albumin** and **globulin** which provided greater water retaining capacity compared to gluten of wheat (Janssen et al., 2017).  

Latvian buckwheat flour presented **high water absorption** ability, which could be explained with the protein composition, a high non-starch **polysaccharides** content and different structure of starch grains which were **polygonal with smaller diameters** than starch grains of wheat (Drobot et al., 2014; Slukova et al., 2017). Christa et al., (2009) concluded that buckwheat starch contains more **hydrophilic** than **hydrophobic**, and starch obtained from native buckwheat seeds had higher water absorption ability than starch obtained from roasted buckwheat seeds.

# Origin and Diffusion 
 
The origin of buckwheat is believed to be the northwestern corner of the Yunnan province of China (25-30°N), a vast plateau in the Himalayan foothills running from Pakistan to Myanmar, where the species grows from 500 to 2,500 m above sea level (Campbell, 1997; Léder, 2009). Today, the species also grows wild in Manchuria and Siberia (Tahir and Farooq, 1988). Human consumption of buckwheat fruits in China probably dates back to **prehistory** and, in the **first millennium B.C.**, its cultivation was **spread** by the nomadic population of the Scythians to Russia and Ukraine, where the oldest findings date back to the beginning of the Iron Age, 700- 600 B.C. (Körber-Grohne, 1987; Hao et al., 1995). The species arrived in northern Europe in the Middle Ages, probably introduced from Siberia, and reached Germany at the beginning of the 15 th century (Williams, 1995). In Europe, it was cultivated either as a summer crop in rotation with rye (Secale cereale L.), or on the poorest soils, and as a pioneer species on new farmland. In northern Germany, buckwheat was used to reclaim moorlands, because it was the only crop able to grow on peaty soils after bog burning (Körber-Grohne, 1987). Buckwheat cultivation was introduced into North America in early colonial days and its production peaked in 1866 (Oplinger et al., 1989). Colonists used it both as a livestock-feed and to obtain flour for human consumption. With later colonisations, buckwheat cultivation also **spread** to Canada, Argentina, Brazil, Australia and South Africa (Jacquemart et al., 2012).  

In Europe, the `zenith` of buckwheat cultivation was reached in the **17 th century**. Later, the **introduction** of `maize and potato` from the `New World` and the diffusion of higher yielding cereals such as `wheat` and `barley`, led to a **rapid decline** in buckwheat cultivation, and in the 19 th -20 th century its cultivation in western Europe was associated with poverty and hunger (Körber-Grohne, 1987; Ahmed et al., 2014). Nevertheless, wide surfaces cultivated with buckwheat were still present in northern Germany during the 19 th century, as can be seen in the portraits of the Weyerberg painters (Cohrs-Zirus Galery, Worpswede near Bremen, Germany). In addition, the famous 19 th century Danish writer, Hans Christian Andersen, dedicated a fairy tale to buckwheat, which clearly suggests that, at the time, the crop was still well known in rural areas of northern Europe.  

Buckwheat is rich in **rutin**, a quercetin-3-rutinoside with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic properties. In humans rutin can `reduce the fragility` of `blood vessels`, which is related to **haemorrhagic** diseases and hypertension (Oomah and Mazza, 1996; Baumgertel et al., 2003). Rutin is not found in other grains such as wheat, rice, and corn, but is found in quantities of 100-200 mg/g dw in buckwheat, which makes buckwheat fruits a major dietary source of rutin (Kreft et al., 2006; Ahmed et al., 2014). **Along** with the various beneficial nutrients and phytochemicals, however, buckwheat contains **fagopyrin**, which is a naftodianthrone related to hypericin (Brockmann et al., 1950, 1952). This substance causes **phototoxic** symptoms, known as **fagopyrism**, in cattle and other farm animals, but it can also affect **humans** (Wender et al., 1943; Stojilkovski et al., 2013; Ahmed et al., 2014). Fagopyrin is mainly present in leaves and flowers and at lower levels in the stems, hulls, and groats (Eguchi et al., 2009).  

**Common** buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) has poor agronomic characteristics, such as low seed yield and lodging. Another species, **Tartary** buckwheat (F. tataricum Gaertn.), has a **bitter** taste, which has constrained its production worldwide. **Common** buckwheat is a self-incompatible, insect-pollinated, allogamous plant.

Buckwheat belongs to the **Fagopyrum genus** and is a promising functional food source containing various phenolic compounds, such as `rutin`, `quercetin`, and C-glycosylﬂavones (orientin, isoorientin vitexin), which have a positive therapeutic or dietary effect for promoting human health. To date, **22 buckwheat species** have been identiﬁed. Most of them are wild buckwheat species, and the two most widely cultivated species are `F. esculentum` (**common** buckwheat) and `F. tataricum` (Tartary buckwheat). **Common buckwheat** is more distributed than Tartary buckwheat, and its range extends from temperate Europe to Japan through the Indo-Myanmar region. In addition, **F. tataricum** is an excellent natural source of phenolic compounds, and, **compared** to F. esculentum, it **has better** nutritional value and antioxidant activities. It has been reported that **F. tataricum contains many more ﬂavonoid** compounds than F. esculentum. source [Buckwheat - Methods and Protocols](https://href.li/?https://www.amazon.com/dp/1071637932)  

The Tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum Gaertn.) is buckwheat species used as food, but its cultivation is **very limited** worldwide compared with **common** buckwheat. In Japan, Tartary buckwheat **never** became an established food crop due to its **bitter** taste (Suzuki et al., 2014a). Tartary buckwheat seeds contain an approximately **100-fold higher concentration of flavonoids** (rutin) than common buckwheat. Tartary buckwheat seeds not only contain a high rutin concentration but also produce a high level of rutinosidase activity, which is capable of hydrolyzing rutin in the prepared flour within a few minutes after adding water (Suzuki et al., 2002).  

Buckwheat it grows well in poor soil conditions and does not require extensive care in terms of fertilization or pest control. However, it does have some specific needs, such as a **well-drained soil** and a relatively **short growing season**.  

The **decline** in buckwheat cultivation was not necessarily due to it requiring more care, but rather because other crops, like **maize** and **potatoes**, offered **higher yields**, better **adaptability** to different soil types, and **greater versatility** in cooking and food production. As agricultural practices evolved and farmers sought to `maximize their output`, they tended to favor these more productive crops **over buckwheat**.  

**Bulgur or Bulgar, or Borghol or πλιγούρι or πουργούρι** is something different, target `buckwheat`!
