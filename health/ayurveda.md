> Ayurveda - The Indian holistic healing

Is scientific framework of healthcare that has saved countless lives over 5,000 years does not need defenders. It is time for the human species to sit up and notice the unique blessings offered by Ayurveda.    

The top-level unique boon of Ayurveda is the implicit promise of true restoration. The promise that the body and mind can be restored to the healthy state from which it descended into sickness. **Instead of just managing the disease**, Ayurveda invites the body–mind to regain its former glory. And no, this is not mythical, like the elixir of youth—it is based on holism, the idea that healthcare must address the individual **as a whole** instead of focusing on just the disease.

It is already established that **overconsumption** of **water** puts extra **stress** on the **kidneys**, washes away important nutrients from the body and strains the system.    

Some of the oral medication might be **bitter**. Meanwhile, other treatment techniques—such as massages—can prove to be quite invigorating and relaxing for both the body and the mind.    

Ayurveda offers equivalent medicines to the **antibiotic** and the painkiller. But the Ayurveda ‘antibiotic’ is intelligent enough to attack only pathogens and leave helpful **gut flora undamaged**. Similarly, the Ayurveda ‘painkiller’ does more than manage symptoms—it addresses the root cause while relieving pain.    

Ayurveda believes that every geographical location is blessed with suitable resources to handle health concerns specific to that geography. Researchers have discovered medicinal plants all over the world. Books have been written on medicinal plants available in Indonesia, Malaysia and Europe.    

There are eight branches in Ayurveda : 
* Kaya - General medicine    
* Bala - Paediatrics    
* Graha - Psychiatry and Psychology    
* Urdhwanga - ENT and Eyes    
* Shalya - Surgery    
* Damshtra - Toxicology    
* Jara - Geriatrics    
* Vrusha - Sexology    

India was an advanced civilization that promoted the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom. India is one of the twelve mega-biodiversity countries of the world. It has ten distinct biogeographic zones, which are further divided into twenty-five biogeographic provinces and over 426 biomes. The ten biogeographic zones in India are :  
* The Trans Himalayan
* Himalayan
* The Desert
* Semi-arid
* Western Ghats
* The Deccan peninsula (including the Eastern Ghats)
* The Gangetic plains
* North-East India
* Coasts
* Islands  

Ayurveda has been using it for **centuries** for the treatment of **high blood pressure** without any **side-effects**. **Modern scientists** have researched this plant and identified a **master molecule** named **reserpine**. They **extracted** it from the plant, **synthesized** it in a laboratory and used it to **make** medicines that would reduce blood pressure. The medicine achieved this objective, but **also caused side-effects** that included depression and suicidal tendencies. After many fatal incidents, the medicine had to be **retracted from the market**. There is a larger story behind this phenomenon. To understand this story, we need to know **how nature works** and how Ayurveda has moulded itself to fit into nature contours.  

These ten distinct biogeographic zones are home to around `17,500 varieties` of flowering plants. Of these, around 8000 have been used for medicinal purposes all over India by villagers, tribal communities and forest dwellers. As many as 1200 of them have been documented in ancient Ayurveda literature. Of these, 400–600 are commonly used and around a hundred have found incredible widespread use. In contrast, `modern medicine` makes medicines using no more than about `thirty plants`. It’s not surprising that Ayurveda, which relies on the supply of diverse plant—and animal—products, found a home in a biodiverse land. Ayurveda also believes that every geographical location is blessed by nature with plants that are needed for the well-being of the community living in that area. Long before humans arrived on the scene, these plants adapted to epochal changes in the environment to become the most suitable life forms in that particular environment.  

Ayurveda trusts every plant and human body to be whole and complete. In the human body, this dynamic equilibrium is maintained by, among other phenomena, homeostasis.  

Many allopathic medicines have a list of side-effects that’s longer than the list of chemicals used to make them.  

Take **antibiotics**, for example—every generation of antibiotics is made **stronger** so as to vanquish newer generations of more resilient superbugs. This also means that every new generation of antibiotics takes a stronger toll on the human body, with the **side-effects** becoming starker. In such a dynamic domain, Ayurveda continues to use medicines free of side-effects, conceptualized and created many centuries ago. How has Ayurveda achieved this?  

Well, Ayurveda studies plants in their entirety. Roots, stems, bark, flowers, fruits and leaves are understood—as constituent yet interconnected parts of the plant—and the therapeutic value of each part is understood. That done, Ayurveda identifies the best way to extract the plant essence for human use.

> Knowledge is useless unless it is shared.

> What you eat (along with your daily habits and the thoughts you think) has the ability to completely transform every aspect of your health.  

In Sanskrit, Ayurveda translates to “the science of life” (ayur is life, veda is knowledge). As a more-than-five-thousand-year-old discipline—the oldest health science to exist—we could spend years unpacking all the knowledge that Ayurveda has to offer.  

Some people refer to Ayurveda as “The Mother of Healing” because it teaches you how to create the ideal environment—internally and externally—for optimal health. Unlike most applications of Western medicine, which focuses on the cure, Ayurveda puts the emphasis on prevention—as in, how we can keep from getting ill in the first place? And by ill, I’m not necessarily talking about the biggies like heart disease, arthritis, or diabetes—though these are absolutely what we’re looking to avoid—but we’re also focusing on the smaller, more subtle irritations that take away from our **everyday quality of life**, like aches and pains, poor sleep, and sluggish digestion. Just as important, Ayurveda addresses more understated conditions that are often the **initial signs** of illness or imbalance in the body, such as dull skin, brittle hair, and low mood and energy. `Because the outside of your body communicates what’s happening on the inside of your body`.
  
Studying nutrition, I learned how food impacts the body, especially plants. They are the very best source of vitamins and minerals, and maintain and nourish our organs and tissues. They are rich in antioxidants, which protect our bodies from environmental stressors and cellular damage. They are full of fiber, which sweeps through our digestive system, clearing the body of toxins and promoting the internal movement on which our life force depends. Plant foods are all we need to deliver the necessary fuel—carbohydrates, fats, and proteins—that every physiological system (digestive, cardiovascular, neurological, immune, etc.) needs to work optimally.  

Ayurveda teaches that everything in the living world, including the food we eat, can be divided into one of three gunas, or modes:  
* SATTVA: the mode of goodness
* RAJAS: the mode of passion
* TAMAS: the mode of ignorance  

At the bottom of the food chain, as it were, are `tamasic` foods. These are considered “low-vibration” foods and have the same vibration-lowering effect on you. Think deep-fried foods, foods that have sat for a long time in the fridge and are sapped of their original nutritional value, and food that involves suffering, such as food derived from animals. These foods require extra energy and effort to digest, and they don’t lift your consciousness or your energy. As a result, they will often leave you lethargic, unmotivated, and meh. They are frequently at the root of many health issues.  
`Rajasic` foods can give you energy, but often only fleetingly and with an aggressive edge. Think processed foods, sweets, and caffeine—things that stimulate you but only with a temporary burst, often followed by a crash in mood or energy. They feed the body at the expense of the mind and long-term health. Rajasic foods can also be plants that possess overstimulating, agitating qualities, such as onions, garlic, chiles, and coffee. That’s why you won’t find many of those ingredients in my recipes—but more on that in a moment.  
And then there are `sattvic` foods. These are free of additives and preservatives and are typically plants in their whole, unprocessed form. Think whole grains, fresh fruit, nuts and seeds, and vegetables. They are easy to digest, elevate the happy hormones in your body (serotonin, dopamine, oxytocin, and endorphins) to lift your mood and help you feel balanced; and they raise your consciousness and your vibrations. It is believed that merely by enjoying more sattvic foods, you are nourishing your mind and making it more receptive to reflection, clarity, and wisdom. This is because sattvic foods produce what’s called ojas. In Sanskrit, ojas translates to “vigor” or “essence of vitality,” and is described as health, vitality, strength, longevity, immunity, and emotional well-being. It is an essential energy for the body and mind.  
When we properly digest sattvic foods, we are creating a sort of ojas smoothie for the body that nourishes all seven layers of our tissues, including our plasma (rasa), blood (rakta), muscle (mamsa), fat (meda), bone marrow (majja), nerve tissue (asthi), and reproductive tissue (shukra). All that goodness squeezed from sattvic foods accumulates over time as a sort of life force, a nectar. When ojas is flowing, you feel grounded, balanced, and stable. Your digestion is robust; you don’t pick up every cold and flu that comes around; you feel light and energized, and while you may sometimes feel tired, you’re not exhausted or defeated. Your hair looks shiny and lush, your skin supple, and eyes white and bright. Ojas is nature’s purest source of life force and energy.  
That said, while eating sattvic foods is one powerful way to create more ojas in your life, if you’re doing it in a way that is at odds with the flow of nature, then you’re still going to feel that friction. So it’s also important to live a sattvic lifestyle—one that honors and supports the 24-hour cycle of our bodies.  

## Live In Rhythm With The Day

Here’s the main thing to understand when it comes to “eating and living in rhythm”: Your body is just as much a product of nature as the sun and the moon. So it makes sense that our internal processes (waking, sleeping, digesting, moving, repairing) follow the same 24-hour tempo. Think about it: The sun rises and brings its light, heat, and radiant energy, which gradually builds and builds until it peaks at midday. After that, the light, the heat, and the energy begin to fade, making way for the moon to rise. As it does, the air cools and the energy shifts toward a slower, sleepier pace. Your body is built to be doing that exact same thing every single day, and our job is to follow its lead. You may have noticed that when you sleep in, you feel sluggish or tired for the rest of the day. Or that you get hungry when you’ve stayed up late into the night. Or that when you eat a late-night meal, you often wake up in the early hours of the morning with your mind racing. All of this makes complete sense once you understand this rhythm.  
Ayurveda describes this 24-hour cycle using the three main doshas: pitta, vata, and kapha. While you may have heard these terms used in quizzes, such as “Which Dosha Are You?” (and it’s true that these doshas can hold the key to better understanding your unique constitution), here we’re using them to describe the different phases of the day. Understanding how each of these doshas “governs” certain times of the day-night cycle will give you insight into how you can better eat, move, and live in harmony with nature. Think of the day as being divided into six equal pieces:   

### 6 A.M. TO 10 A.M.: KAPHA
**Kapha** elemental makeup is earth and water and is, by extension, stabilizing, solid, and strong. Waking up just before this period or in the very beginning of this window is optimal—closer to 6 a.m. than 10 a.m. Getting out of bed toward the middle or tail end of this phase can leave you with the “I just slept for 10 hours but still don’t feel rested” feeling. It’s often the best time to exercise because you can bring gentle stimulation to all your body’s physiological systems and ease them out of the stagnation of being asleep. While your body isn’t quite ready to accept its first proper meal of the day, you can prepare the digestive system with something light and easy to digest such as Spiced Stewed Apples or a beverage such as CCF Detox Tea or Masala Chai.  

### 10 A.M. TO 2 P.M.: PITTA
**Pitta** is linked to fire; it is dynamic and action-oriented. Just as the fire of the sun is carving its way to its peak in the sky, so too is your digestive fire revving up. In Ayurveda, we really do use the term agni or “fire” to describe the furnace churning in your belly that converts food into the energy that fuels the body’s engine. Just as this time of day is ideal for using that fire to metabolize bigger meals, it’s also perfect for metabolizing your biggest thoughts and tackling your biggest tasks.  

### 2 P.M. TO 6 P.M.: VATA
**Vata** is ruled by air and ether and governs the nervous system. Since this is the phase when the nervous system can be heightened, think about leaning into the vata qualities of creativity, movement, and flow as a way to balance and ground yourself. Think about creating a peaceful environment, shifting from the left-brained analytical work you did in the morning to softer, more imaginative and creative right-brained tasks, and partaking in activities that calm rather than excite or stimulate. This will serve you as you transition between the events of the day and the preparation for evening.  

### 6 P.M. TO 10 P.M.: KAPHA
The sun setting brings a return to **kapha** in its slowest, most grounded form. Your digestive fire dwindles, which means meals during this time should be light and easy to digest (the reason why I particularly love soups for dinner). This is also the time to help your body wind down and transition to sleep. Getting into bed by the end of this phase is ideal for falling asleep more easily and getting the deepest, most restful sleep. Many people find that if they miss this window for bedtime, they get a second burst of energy that makes sleep difficult. (Which is not such a mystery once you see what happens during the next window!)

### 10 P.M. TO 2 A.M.: PITTA
Even though you are at rest during this time, your body systems are kicking back into gear for their night shift. This is when your digestive system, circulatory system, and nervous system metabolize and process the day. They take out the trash by flushing unwanted toxins from the brain and the digestive tract, as well as rebuild and repair your cells. However, if you’re awake during that time, or more significantly, digesting a meal during that time, it inhibits those processes from happening. Can you think back to a night when you went in for a late-night pizza and woke up feeling groggy and sluggish? When you’re asking your body to take on too much work at night, your sleep will suffer.  

### 2 A.M. TO 6 A.M.: VATA
Another transitional moment of the day as the sun prepares to rise and the body prepares to be awake. Just as the afternoon vata window is a time of creativity, this moment is one of receptivity to information, ideas, and energy. Many practitioners of Ayurveda believe the optimal time to wake and meditate is before sunrise or before the energy shifts from moon to sun.  
The goal here is to simply allow yourself to feel the qualities of these moments in the day—the lightness of vata as your body first stirs and takes in the sun’s early rays, the urgency of pitta powering the afternoon’s big wave of energy, the heaviness of kapha as you turn down the lights and bury yourself in the blankets with a book. If you are like most people, this will take some getting used to. We’re so accustomed to living our lives against these currents that we don’t often experience them. But the more you participate in these ebbs and flows and support them with the meals you eat, the practices you choose, and the thoughts you think (aka following the advice shared in this book!), the more in alignment you will become.  
While every day may not look just like this, what will naturally happen over time is that you’ll realize how much better you feel when it does. If you want more restful sleep, or you want more energy in the morning, or you want better concentration in the afternoon, the solution isn’t to hyperfocus your efforts on that time of day. Instead, when you’re supporting all of the shifts throughout the day, the benefits are cumulative.  

I fell in love with Ayurveda because of its key idea that we have the power not only to recognize our symptoms of imbalance before they build to something more damaging but also to treat them by creating subtle shifts in our routines, whether it’s what we eat, how we move, or the habits we keep in our spiritual practices or our living space.
Ayurveda demonstrates how each of us has our own natural disposition, and because of that, your long-term recipe for health will look different from anyone else’s. It’s far from a one-size-fits-all prescription.  
My guidelines and recipes are designed to help you tune in closely to what your body might be asking of you and what it needs to feel good and nourished. But instead of getting too caught up at this moment with what you “should” or “shouldn’t” be eating based on your type or prakruti (as one’s overall constitution is called in Ayurveda), or getting too bogged down in the many, many layers of philosophy behind these recommendations, I’d rather you first embrace more general practices, rooted in Ayurveda, that everyone benefits from. These are simply:

### Eating more plants and spices
Living in rhythm with nature and your own body
Surrounding yourself with the energy, attitude, intention, and feelings with which you want to fill yourself and that’s pretty much it; easy-peasy, right? Okay, maybe not exactly a quick fix (nothing that really works is!)—but hey, when was the last time someone told you to eat delicious food in a deeply satisfying way as a prescription for feeling amazing?
Once you’ve started implementing the changes above, you’ll be able to hear that voice saying This is what I want or This is what I need—and you’ll know the difference between the two (and, yes, hopefully that voice is kind and sweet and doesn’t sound like Darth Vader!). Trusting your instincts will empower you to be the authority on your own health. You will know what you need to tweak and fine-tune as you evolve.

## The Recipes Follow The Cycle Of The Day
To help you get and stay in rhythm, I’ve organized the chapters to reflect which meals you’d reach for at certain times of day. Recipes early in the book (drinks, breakfast) are perfect for lighter morning meals, while recipes in the middle of the book (pasta, lentils, breads, salads, main dishes) are better suited for midday, when your digestion is more robust. Toward the end of the book (soups), we’re returning to lighter dishes that suit a body preparing for rest (although these dishes would be just as appropriate earlier in the day, too).
When choosing a recipe, ask yourself: What does my body need right now? What is it truly hungry for? What sounds delicious to meet that need? Honor the voice that responds.
Another part of this tuning-in process is Living with the Sun and Moon. Each of these bodies has its own powerful vibrations. Thinking about their qualities and the time of day when they “rule” as you consider what nourishment your body needs helps you to live in vibration with them. For example:  
* Sun vs Moon
* Energizing vs Calming
* Heating vs Cooling
* Activating vs Relaxing
* Strength vs Flow
* Creation vs Preservation
* Activating vs Surrender

For both men and women: Masculine (active, doing) vs. Feminine (processing emotions, soothing, nurturing).  

## Bring Intention Into The Mix
Practitioners of Ayurveda believe that the energy, attitude, intention, and feelings you have while cooking are infused into the food—which is then absorbed and digested into the person receiving it. That’s why one of my very favorite things to do is feed people when they come to my home. I love putting thought into what nourishing, delicious meal I can prepare for them, and then actively reflecting on and praying for their well-being as I cook.   And what’s amazing is that my guests often tell me that they can actually sense that.  
It may sound woo-woo, but the thoughts you think and the intention you bring to the simplest acts, including preparing your food, are powerful. That means that cooking with love, devotion, gratitude, and kind energy is just as healing—for both body and mind—as the food itself. In Ayurveda, we call this Prashad. I often describe it as food cooked with devotion, sealed with a prayer, and served with love. In your everyday life, you can think of it as **conscious cooking**. Conscious cooking is just what it sounds like: cooking with your mind turned on. It is not throwing together ingredients as you rush to get to work or zone out to your favorite show (although there is definitely a time and place for that). It is a simple daily practice that elevates the humblest meals, and here are a few ways to do it.  

* Envision the meal you are going to prepare, the people you will feed, and how it will nourish them—even if it’s just yourself.
* Cook without distraction so you can focus your energy on the food and the act of preparing it.
* Imagine how this food will give your body the energy to do good in the world through whatever unique skills you have.
* Offer gratitude for these ingredients and this moment of being alive on the planet, whether it’s to God or the Universe. For me, this is a key part of my consciousness-raising practice.  

People who are transitioning to a plant-based diet are sometimes concerned that they’re going to miss out on certain nutrients by not eating animal foods. But you can get everything you need from eating a variety of plants—and without the discomfort- and disease-causing qualities of tamasic and rajasic animal foods.

### But Will I Get Enough Protein?

This is quite possibly the most **common question vegans are asked**. To be honest, that was my concern, too, when I transitioned from being a **vegetarian** to a **vegan**. Luckily, there are numerous studies that offer peace of mind. In 2013, the *Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics* published the largest study to date that compared the protein intake of 71,000 vegans, vegetarians, and nonvegetarians. On average, the vegans and vegetarians actually exceeded their protein needs by 70 percent. If you are eating an assortment of plants throughout the week, you will get the nutrition you need.

#### What About Complete Proteins?

I’ve often heard people argue that animal proteins, unlike those from plants, provide what’s sometimes called a **complete protein**, meaning you’re getting **all nine essential amino acids** (compounds essential to the body biological processes, such as transporting nutrients and healing cells, and nourishing hair, skin, and nails) **in one place**. The truth is, so long as you’re getting all nine essential amino acids, it **doesn’t matter whether they come from a single food source or multiple**. I like to make the point that even if you are eating a complete protein (such as tofu), it gets broken down into amino acids anyway, so you might as well get them with a side of antioxidants, phytonutrients, and fiber (versus the inflammation, hormone disruption, calcium malabsorption, and heart disease and cancer risk you’d get **from animal foods**). Ultimately, if you eat animals, you’re only getting as much nutrition as that animal gets through the plants they eat—so why not go immediately to the source and get your protein from plants themselves?!

#### Build Meals With The Six Tastes In Mind

In Ayurveda, we believe that there are six essential tastes, and to enjoy them in harmony not only creates more balanced meals but also recalibrates our body, mind, and spirit.
When each of the six tastes, or flavors, are combined on your plate, your meals will become even more deeply satisfying. This is in part because all your different taste buds are being stimulated. But on a much deeper level, these tastes have different effects on your physiology. Sweet is grounding, sour awakens digestion, salty aids the absorption of minerals, pungent improves circulation, bitter is detoxifying, and astringent clears the mind. The key is maintaining a balance between these tastes, which in turn preserves balance in the body. The six tastes are :  
* **SWEET**: Fruits, sweet vegetables such as pumpkin and sweet potato, grains, natural sugars, and nut milks, as well as spices such as cinnamon, cardamom, and coriander
* **SOUR**: Sour fruits (lemons, limes, tamarind), yogurt, and other fermented ingredients
* **SALTY**: Seaweed, celery, black olives, tamari, soy sauce, and salt in all forms
* **ASTRINGENT**: Beans, pulses/legumes, some raw fruits (persimmon, fresh cranberries, pomegranate, green grapes, citrus zest, unripe bananas), alfalfa sprouts, okra, turmeric, and green and black tea
* **BITTER**: Dark leafy greens, arugula, eggplant, sesame seeds, some fresh herbs (such as parsley, thyme, dill), and some spices (such as fenugreek, turmeric, and cloves)
* **PUNGENT**: Chiles, garlic, ginger, asafoetida, mustard greens, spinach, spelt, and buckwheat, plus some spices (such as black pepper, mustard seeds, paprika, cayenne) and herbs (such as oregano, rosemary, and sage)

#### A Note About Nightshades

There’s a group of plants called “nightshades” that, according to Ayurveda, are not recommended as part of your regular diet. These include eggplants, tomatoes, peppers, and potatoes, and the thinking is that these foods are rajasic, or overstimulating, overheating, and inflammatory—similar to garlic and onion.  

These are all interchangeable:  
* Cashews and sunflower seeds
* All unsweetened vegan milks
* All nut and seed butters (the flavor may change slightly)
* Garlic and asafoetida
* Dried and fresh herbs
* Dried and fresh curry leaves
* Ground cumin and cumin seeds
* Ground CCF Masala and garam masala
* Coconut sugar and jaggery
* Maple syrup and agave
* Liquid aminos and soy sauce or tamari
* Cornstarch and tapioca starch
* Plain bread crumbs and almond flour
* Coconut milk and vegan cream

Kitchen staples for me include:  
* Chef’s knife
* Mandoline
* Cutting board
* Measuring cups and spoons
* Mixing bowls (large, medium, small)
* Silicone or rubber spatula
* Cast-iron skillet
* Rolling pin (whichever type you like)
* Fine-mesh sieve
* Colander

#### Avoid Snacking
Your body needs at least 3 hours to digest a meal, so eating between meals can disrupt the digestive process and lead to incomplete digestion. Over time, this can result in the accumulation of ama or toxins, which can present as any number of mild to moderate symptoms, such as bloating, gas, grogginess, diarrhea, lack of appetite, fatigue, bad breath, residue on the tongue, and strong-smelling sweat.  

#### Eat Your Dessert Before Dinner
If you’re following Ayurvedic practices to the letter, then ideally you would enjoy sweeter indulgences before a meal, not after. That’s because sweets are always digested first, so if any other food is in your system, your body will stop digesting it in favor of the sweet, leading the undigested food to ferment and toxins to accumulate in your digestive system.  

#### Go For A Walk
While sitting or lying down after a meal may be tempting, try to resist. Sitting essentially squashes the digestive tract and slows digestion. It can even lead to indigestion. Instead, go for a little stroll, a lil’ dawdle—nothing crazy, just 10 to 15 minutes—then come home and get cozy on that sofa.

## My 5 a.m.-ish Morning Routine
About ten years ago, when I was first starting down the path of meditation and developing my spiritual practice, I wanted to go all in. So I started waking up at 3:45 a.m. to meditate with the monks at a local temple called Bhaktivedanta Manor in Watford, England. The experience was so transformative and miraculous that I kept it up for a year and a half. But eventually I wanted to give myself a little more time to sleep in. So I ended up settling into a 5 a.m.-ish wake-up time and a morning routine, which over the years has brought definition and joy to my life.  
Getting up early might seem beyond what you can imagine right now, but think about it this way: The time before the sun comes up has the moon’s calming, soothing energy, which is powerful for supporting prayer, meditation, and reflection. And I guarantee you that eventually, once you set the habit of getting up earlier and experiencing all the special moments with the world before the sun’s go, go, go energy takes over, you’ll adjust to it. It’s also important to point out that my morning routine is made possible by an intentional, sleep-promoting nighttime routine.  
These are the highlights of my morning routine. I don’t always manage to do all of them, but having each of these practices in my toolbox means I can pick and choose as time and mood allows. I invite you to choose any piece or pieces of it that speak to you and build from there.  

* **Tongue Scraping And Marma Mat**: While I’m at the sink brushing my teeth, I’m also accomplishing two vital parts of my morning routine. First, I’m using a tongue scraper, which is exactly what it sounds like—a small U-shaped tool that scrapes the surface of your tongue to clear away bacteria that accumulated overnight, which Ayurveda says can lead to illness. And while I’m brushing and scraping, I’m also standing on my marma mat, an acupressure mat that stimulates the 72,000 nerve endings in my feet that connect to every part of the body. Stimulating these pressure points can relieve pain, fatigue, muscle tension, and stress, in addition to encouraging the movement of lymph fluid, your body’s detoxification system. That’s what you call efficiency!
* **Gharshana (Dry Brushing)**: By using a stiff bristle brush to make long, gentle strokes over your skin, you’re sloughing off old skin cells as well as stimulating your lymphatic system. Lymph fluid lives all over your body and is like a river that removes waste and toxins. So helping it circulate is not only cleansing but also keeps your immune system strong. I like doing this for a couple of minutes before I get into the shower or before bed. Give yourself 2 or 3 minutes to move the brush up your legs and arms (toward the heart, always), as well as in circular motions on your belly.
* To gently wake up my digestion and introduce much-needed hydration into my body after sleep, I make myself a pot of CCF Tea.

#### 5:30 a.m. Meditation
* Light A Candle And Burn Some Incense: Before I settle in for my morning meditation, I set the tone and intention by lighting a candle.
* Settle In: Wherever I’ve lived, whether in a tiny apartment or a house, I’ve always had a dedicated space for my morning meditation—even if it’s just a little pillow. Your meditation space doesn’t have to be fancy, but do try to have a regular place, which helps reinforce the habit. It could be the corner of your bedroom or living room, or outside on your fire escape.
* Yogic Breathwork: A few rounds of mindful breathwork help me settle into the practice and calm my mind.
* Mantra Meditation: I’ve tried various meditation styles, but my daily practice is mantra meditation. When practicing your mantra meditation, remember that it is a deep calling in the spirit of service and a deep exchange between you and your soul. What’s most important to me during this time—and what helps me stay absorbed and focused—is to incorporate all of my senses. In the beginning, your meditation may only last 5 or 10 minutes. But over time, you’ll enjoy sitting for longer and longer. During the past decade, I’ve worked my way up from 10 minutes to an hour and a half, and I’ve seen the difference in my life: I feel more focused, clear, creative, and connected. Yes, it can take a while to feel the effects of meditation, and some days the practice feels tougher than others, but the experiences that carry the most meaning can sometimes take the longest to come to fruition. It’s like building a relationship with your partner or a friend—it takes time to nurture a deep, meaningful connection with yourself.  

#### 7:30 a.m. Reading
To transition out of my meditation, I’ll read for 10 to 15 minutes.  

#### 8 a.m. Exercise
Ayurveda recommends first moving your body before 10 a.m. in order to get your blood pumping and your endorphins flowing and to stimulate all your physiological systems to transition them from sleep. I like to take at least 30 minutes to get a sweat on.  

#### 10:30/11 a.m. Breakfast
Now it’s time to nourish and replenish. This is when I introduce my first meal of the day, which tends to be light in order not to overwhelm my digestive flame, which hasn’t built to a full roar just yet.  

### Tuning In with Your Breath

Breath is the bridge between your mind and your body, so it makes sense that whenever you want to feel more focused, more present, more connected with your body, or just want to experience a different frequency, you go back to where it all begins. Doing just a few minutes of these breathwork exercises throughout the day can pull you back into the moment and return you to the rhythm of the day.  

#### The Rise And Shine: Surya Namaskar

There’s a reason this stretch-breathwork combo is called “sun salutations”—it’s meant to greet the rising sun (and shake the desire to hit the snooze button again). These ten simple yoga postures prepare your body for whatever is to come that day. There are tall, proud stances, surrendering stances, challenging stances—it’s almost like they are a dress rehearsal for the feelings and moods that may arise during the day. Do just one round, and do it deeply, and it will be a very powerful practice.  

#### The Glow Up: Full Yogic Breath

Full Yogic Breath revitalizes the entire body with prana (essential life force). It literally breathes new life into our vital organs, which can become stagnant and constricted with emotional and physical tension. (Yes, organs get stressed, too!) Full Yogic Breath relieves stress and unwinds tension, mainly by soothing the parasympathetic nervous system, which is a network of nerves responsible for recalibrating your body after periods of stress or danger, helping you return to a calm, relaxed state. So when you support this vital—and frequently used—function, you’ll feel refreshed, clear-minded, and balanced. You can reach for this breath any time, but it’s especially beneficial early in the morning, preferably on an empty stomach.  
Start by inhaling slowly into your lower abdomen. Then bring your breath into the midsection of your torso, followed by the diaphragm and ribs, and finally, into the upper chest and shoulders. To exhale, release your breath just as slowly and in the reverse order—chest, diaphragm, midtorso, lower belly. A full round is both the inhale and exhale. Aim for at least 5 minutes every day and work your way up to 15, imagining you are filling your entire body with sunshine as you breathe.  

#### The Pump-Up: Breath Of Fire

This quick, dynamic breath delivers a hit of oxygen to your brain (its name, kapalabhati, literally translates to “shining skull breath”), which is perfect for feeling focused and energized.  
Sit comfortably, then begin taking in short, quick breaths through the nose and exhaling deeply from your stomach through your mouth (making a “ha” sound). Start with 1 minute, which is plenty to wake up your body.  

#### The Equalizer: Anulom Vilom

Anulom vilom, or alternate nostril breathing, is perfect for when you’re transitioning from the high-intensity midday pitta energy to slower, gentler end-of-day vata energy, maybe getting a little sluggish, and want calm focus without feeling like you’ve just had a shot of espresso (which also happens to be the effect of my Iced Matcha Tahini Latte).  
Anulom vilom brings alertness and balance to the left and right hemispheres of your brain. Begin by folding down your ring and pinky fingers on one hand and place your middle and pointer finger on your third eye (the spot on your forehead between your eyebrows). Use the knuckle of your ring finger to gently close one nostril and take a deep inhale. Hold for a few seconds, then release that nostril and plug the other nostril with your thumb. Exhale deeply through the second nostril. Breathe in through that same nostril and reverse the process, alternating nostrils and breathing like this for 1 to 2 minutes. You may notice that one nostril brings in air more effortlessly; that corresponds to the opposite hemisphere of your brain, which is likely your dominant side (i.e., left brain or right brain). When you’re finished, you’ll feel calm, awake, and refreshed.  

#### The Nightcap: Deep Belly Breathing

When it’s time to wind down and prepare your body for sleep, it’s the perfect moment to focus on deep breathing. You can do this lying or sitting in bed.  
Take a deep inhale through your nose and feel the breath flowing down your throat, to your chest, and finally, filling up your belly. Then release it from your belly, feeling the breath come back through your chest, neck, and out of your mouth. Breathe deeply and slowly, focusing on the completion of the inhalation and exhalation. At the bottom of each breath, you should have no breath left to inhale or exhale, which will help release any stagnant air sitting in your belly. Notice your thoughts, sit with them, and observe them like clouds, then let them pass by. You can also focus on a different body part with each breath—I like to work from my feet up to my head. Think about completely relaxing that part of your body with each exhale. I recommend 5 minutes of this to give yourself time to unwind from the events of the day.  


#### Spices & Herbs
Coming from an Indian family, I feel like I’ve known since birth how `incredible spices and herbs` are when it comes to creating bold, flavorful meals. But now that I understand their natural healing properties, I turn to my spice box as my medicine cabinet. Spices possess the power to lower your stress hormones, reduce inflammation, regulate blood sugar, keep you feeling more grounded, flush toxins from your body, improve digestion, and alleviate discomfort. They are your secret weapon to feeling happy and healthy. Spices are easy to use, even if they are not called for in a recipe: Sprinkle them on food, steep them in water for tea, stir them into coffee, blend them into smoothies, fold them into baked goods—there’s no wrong way to enjoy them!  
Just remember that spices have more **prana** or **vital** life force, and therefore more medicinal potency as well as flavor, when freshly ground. You can grind them with a coffee grinder or mortar and pestle. And, as you’ll see in the table below, `the spices flavors are released and medicinal properties activated when you cook them in fat` before eating them.  

> **GPT** : Cooking spices in fat (such as oil or butter) can help release their flavors and activate their medicinal properties. The **fat acts as a medium** that extracts and carries the essential oils and compounds found in spices, enhancing their flavor and aroma. This process is often used in cooking techniques like sautéing or frying, where spices are added to hot oil to maximize their impact in a dish. Additionally, some **medicinal properties** of spices may be **better absorbed** by the body when they are cooked in fat, as certain compounds are fat-soluble.  

| Spice/Herb | Health Bene­fits | Taste | Contra­indications | Best Way to Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ajwain | *   Alleviates gas, bloating, and indigestion<br>*   Stimulates appetite<br>*   Helps regulate cholesterol and blood pressure | Slightly bitter, herbal taste with notes of oregano, celery seed, and a hint of anise. |     | Can be used as whole seeds or ground. |

Buy preground (less potent). |
| Oregano | *   Antibacterial and anti-inflammatory<br>*   Boosts immunity and digestion | Earthy, “green” flavor with hints of mint and hay. |     | Can be used fresh or dried. |
| Paprika | *   Antioxidant<br>*   Relieves gas<br>*   Boosts immunity<br>*   Prevents premature wrinkles<br>*   Increases circulation<br>*   Brings healthy color to skin | Domestic paprika is mild and sweet. Spanish paprikas can be smoky. |     | Found in powdered form and can be used to season dishes. |

Ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease are two chronic **inflammatory bowel diseases** whose incidence is increasing in the West. Seen mostly in young adults it is the cause of much morbidity. It is believed that the increased formation of the inflammatory mediators known as `leukotrienes` plays an important role in causing and maintaining chronic inflammation. Therefore attempts have been made to find specific **inhibitors** of leukotriene **synthesis**. However, such products, on evaluation showed unsuitable attributes like poor bioavailability, susceptibility to oxidation, side effects and were toxic. The gum **resin** of the tree `Boswellia serrata`, shown to be a specific inhibitor of leukotriene synthesis, is used in Ayurveda in a variety of inflammatory conditions [1].

## Masala Chai

Chai Masala ingredients :  
* ¾ cup ground ginger
* ½ cup ground cardamom
* ¼ cup freshly ground black pepper
* ¼ cup ground cinnamon
* ¼ cup ground cloves
* 2 tablespoons ground nutmeg  

Use a mortar and pestle or spice grinder to grind the spices together into a fine powder. Transfer the mixture to a tightly sealed jar and store in a cool, dark place for up to 2 weeks.

then brew tea :
* 1 to 2 black tea bags (optional), to taste
* 1 teaspoon Homemade Chai Masala, or store-bought
* 1 sprig fresh mint
* ¼ teaspoon minced or grated fresh ginger (optional)
* 1 cup unsweetened vegan milk
* 1 teaspoon coconut sugar, plus more to taste  

In a medium saucepan, bring 1 cup water to a boil over high heat. Add the tea bags (if using), the masala, mint, and ginger (if using) and return to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer, then immediately return the mixture to a boil. Repeat this once more and then bring the mixture back down to a simmer. Stir in the milk and sugar and return to a boil once more, breathing in the lovely aromas that will now be rising from the pan. Remove the pan from the heat, strain half the mixture over a mug, and do the same over a second mug with the remainder of the mixture and serve.

## Calm (Chamomile & Star Anise)
* 1 cup plain unsweetened vegan milk
* 1 tablespoon dried chamomile flowers or 1 chamomile tea bag
* 2 whole star anise
* 1 teaspoon date syrup or sweetener of choice
* 1 teaspoon saffron threads (optional)  

In a small saucepan, combine the milk, chamomile, star anise, date syrup, and saffron (if using) and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Immediately reduce to a simmer, then right away increase the heat back to medium-high and bring to a boil once more. (The idea is to let the mixture brew properly without the milk overflowing.) Again, reduce to a simmer before the milk comes over the edge of the pot. Then return to a boil again, reduce to a simmer, and cook for 3 to 5 minutes, until your kitchen smells delightful. Remove the chamomile tea bag (if using) or strain out the chamomile flowers and the star anise and serve.
