## introduction

Human vandalized his body every day. Take a look, what is as raw food in comparison of what you eat. If you consider that :

* 80% of immune system is on gut.
* till as 2022, doctors they not taught about small intestine, even gastrologists going till the entrance of [duodenum](https://www.innerbody.com/image_dige02/dige21.html) (the first part of small intestine).  

we have to be more protective for our **gastrointestinal system**.  

Have in mind that **garlic**, **antibiotics** destroy the intestinal microflora (kill bad & good bacteria). They saying, that, when take 1 pill antibiotic, to recover as was, takes 6 months. Thats why the **new ERA** doctors when prescribe antibiotics always add probiotics as well (2 hours before or after the bomb).  

**Probiotics** (green / animal) are the good bacteria that should be present in a healthy intestinal tract.  

**Prebiotics** (aka fermentable fiber) is what good bacteria eating to thrive, grow, properly colonize, and ensure they do not quickly **die off**....  

-----  

In a very short description, on how it works, when you eat something goes to stomach then to [small intestine](https://www.britannica.com/science/small-intestine) (where the absortion is made) then throw the waste to [large intestine](https://www.britannica.com/science/large-intestine) then poop.  

This **century** health problem, has to do with **small intestine**. More and more new diseases popping out. Responsible is what we eat, or more specific how the `raw` products we buying from super market `cultivated`, `grow`, `prepared` and `preserved`. Something change on production line (compared to previous century) yeah the people made more greedy and profitable....  

And guess what(?), still, there is no **home device** to drop a food and analyze it if is good/bad for eating... Anyway, the consumer has to rethink what is buying as `food` because in most situations is not `food`, is garbage.  When garbaging your body for years diseases occurring.  

This affect any mothefucker, vegan or carnivore.  

## realization & diagnosis

2020 - A team, led by Magnus SimrÃ©n, MD, PhD, Professor of Gastroenterology at Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, found nearly **40% of adults suffer from a functional gastrointestinal disorder** in a 73,000 people, 33 country survey.

`leaky-gut` is the precursor to food sensitivities, rashes, hormones imbalance, cognitive issues, and even autoimmune disease.

You can not feel anything at the moment and nobody can diagnosed **leaky-gut** except if you do a `Pathological examination by Bioresonance` (find doctor with [Asyra](https://www.asyra.co.uk/)), there will show **epithelial cells** have a gap (aka inflammation).. When there is gap on epithelial cells **shits** going in to your blood stream, unfiltered.

`Zonulin` is a protein that regulates tight junctions. Research has shown that higher levels of this protein may loosen tight junctions and increase intestinal permeability. **Zonulin test** - [Alessio Fasano - role of zonulin on leaky gut](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6996528/) [[ 2 ](https://drgoodmannd.com/2017/10/zonulin-a-way-to-test-for-leaky-gut/)] [[ 3 ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8C1BzAo6-8)] [[ 4 ](https://youtu.be/l8C1BzAo6-8?t=56)] [[ 5 (GR) ](https://athenslab.gr/exetaseis-prolipsis/zonoulini-kopranon-1521)]

The body starts with a **skin condition** like flares, rashes, hives, papules, eczema, dermographism, gynecomastia due high estrogen hormone, you name it... Then the **traditional doctors** can diagnosed histamine intolerance / IBS / Crohn / Colitis...  

I would like to point out that `Interventional Radiology` doctors can diagnose **gastrointestinal cysts**.  

`histamine intolerance` is assumed to be due to a **deficiency** of the gastrointestinal (GI) enzyme `DAO` (diamine oxidase) and, therefore, the food component histamine not being degraded and/or absorbed properly within the GI tract.   [source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8069563/)  
Since your intestines are where most of the `DAO` enzyme is produced, your body may produce less DAO when the **gut is inflamed** (`leaky-gut`), thus leading to a build up of histamine.  [source](https://rootfunctionalmedicine.com/curing-histamine-intolerance)  

## food

I can understand, that till now, some people, eat to insure that are not hungry.. You have to delete this from your dashboard and take care seriously what you add to your mouth... There is no special recipe, each person is different, you have to perform tests on your daily foods. From my understandings the following must be avoided on all situations : 
* garlic
* vinegar
* tomato
* chocolate (except small portions of [Milka](https://www.milka.be/) or [Magnum](https://www.magnumicecream.com/us/en/flavors/icecream-bars/double-chocolate-ice-cream-bar.html))
* ham
* milk
* aged cheese
* wine
* spinach
* can foods (tuna included)
* fermented foods (example pickle / kombucha / kimchi / sauerkraut)
* spicy (even pepper or oregano)  

easy to cook 5 days schedule : 
* rice / pasta (130gr) w/ frozen vegs (100gr)
* meat (chicken breast / liver / pork tomahawk) (~250gr-300gr)
* rice / pasta w/ frozen vegs
* fish (COD / tuna / salmon) fresh or frozen (~250gr-300gr)
* legumes (blackeye / lentils) (100gr)

when eat outside (max 2 days / week) preferred cuisines :
* Asian
* Vietnamese
* Thai  

those cuisines don't have garlic or tomatoes in their plates....  

* pasta prefer `durum wheat`, soak for 15min, when is not spaghetti.
* rice ( jasmin / basmati ) soak for 15min.
* for liver [soak in milk](https://therustyspoon.com/why-do-you-soak-liver-in-milk-before-cooking/)
* for beans soak overnight, make sure cooked for 1h
* do [spouting](/health/sprouting.md) with mung beans (aka green small beans), eat 3 times / day one palm.
* breakfast bran / oat flakes

for cereal & bread, choose only whole wheat.
* The mutligrain bread, is made by white floor and include grains.
* The whole wheat bread is made by wholemeal.

## medicines

For starters, start ASAP getting `PREBIOTIC` of type `Psyllium` (always prefer capsule no powder) - 30min before lunch..

The following are discovered over the internet, all tried by myself, use it on your own risk...  
* (rebuild) `L-Glutamine` 3g / day (or as [product](https://store.amymyersmd.com/products/leaky-gut-revive))
* (rebuild) `Fulvic acid` 5ml x 3 times / day as a [product](https://intelligenceofnature.com/) - Terrahydrite is a lignite which contains humic acid within turn contains fulvic acid.
* (rebuild) `Quercetin` 500mg x 2 times / day ([suggested by](https://chriskresser.com/quercetin-heal-leaky-gut/)) - flavonoid found in high amounts in onions, kale and apples.
* (rebuild+detox) `Aloe vera` gel - 50mg x 3 times / day ([proven by](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2763764/))
* (detox) `Activated vegetable carbon` 3x200mg x 3 times / day (max 2 weeks) - stool may turn black is harmless.
* (rebuild) `Bifidobacterium strains` (two products, see at the end of the page)  

In case of `PROBIOTICS` and you are with `histamine intolerance` the following found through internet :   
* Number of `strains` may be reduced, specific some Lactobacillus strains can be beneficial, but they produce enough histamine that may cause trouble for those with histamine intolerance. Also better to avoid `Curcumin`.
* valid probiotic when the subject has `histamine intolerance` / `IBS`
  * Bifidobacterium longum BB536 ( aka Morinaga BB536 )  ([reference](https://old.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/65ifz6/ibsc_sibo_cured_with_single_strain_bb536_probiotic/))
  * Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 ( longum subspecies ) ([reference](https://www.symbiosys.com/symbiosys-alflorex/))  
  -- this [supplement](https://www.seekinghealth.com/products/probiota-histaminx-60-capsules) includes only those
  * Bifidobacterium bifidum & BB536 & 35624
  * Lactobacillus salivarius
  * Lactobacillus plantarum
  * Bifidobacterium lactis
  * Bifidobacterium breve  


> All people must follow the 12h fasting (aka 8pm - 8am) every day. Because when gut is empty, allowing to start cleansing processes.

## (probiotic) Alflorex (Bifidobacterium longum 35624)  

per capsule : 1 billion CFU (coloning forming units)  
dose : strictly one capsule per day  

### leaflet  

Bifidobacterium 35624 culture was isolated from the **healthy human gut** and has been extensively characterised and tested by scientists, clinicians and gastroenterologists. It is backed by over 15 years of research and over 50 scientific publications. Strain belongs to the family of bacteria that are **passed** from mother to baby at **birth** and live naturally in the human gut. It passes through the digestive system and reaches the intestine alive.

### What is the intestinal microbiota?  

The intestinal microbiota (formerly known as "gut flora") is the totality of all microorganisms, especially bacteria and yeasts, in the intestine. Almost **100 billion microorganisms live in a natural balance in the intestine**. There are ten times more microorganisms in the human gut **than** there are cells in the human body. It has now been established that the intestinal microbiota plays an **important** role in maintaining human health, **particularly** in the area of the digestive system. The balance of the intestinal microbiota can be **disturbed** by various factors. The resulting **imbalance** in the intestinal flora is referred to as `dysbiosis`. This dysbiosis can adversely affect our health and digestive functions.
