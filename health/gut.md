Low-diversity dysbiosis (Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae) are responsible for fermenting complex sugars into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as `butyrate`. Low-diversity dysbiosis leads to a **decrease** in butyrate and other important **SCFAs**.  

Most experts will tell you that there are only two ways to make **more mitochondria**: by fasting and/or exercising. But I’m here to tell you that there are actually several other ways to invoke `mitogenesis`— and you can get the resources you need to do so by following the **eating tricks** listed here.  


> At the end of the day, **you are only as healthy as your mitochondria**.  

## feeding more
Mitochondria is actually another benefit since **uncoupling** allows you to waste calories and take fat out of storage to **feed** your **new** mitochondria. Further, uncoupling mitochondria produces **heat** through a process called `thermogenesis` that **promotes** weight loss, vitality, and good health.  

It turns out that `polyphenols` are one of the primary (and favorite) food sources of many of your `**gut buddies**`.  

Another important type of polyphenol is called **ellagitannins**. If you have the **right mix** of `**gut buddies**`, they can use ellagitannins, which are found primarily in :  
* berries 
* pomegranates
* walnuts  

to produce a metabolite called **urolithin A**. At **lab**, when urolithin A is given to worms, it increases their **life span** by 50 percent! In humans **reduce cartilage** degeneration and pain in people with **osteoarthritis**.  

In their research at Stanford University, Erica and Justin Sonnenburg showed that humans fed a `high-fiber` diet did **not** see an improvement in their gut **microbiome biodiversity** or their levels of **inflammation**. But when they supplemented with `fermented` foods such as :
* kefir
* kombucha
* yogurt
* kraut (aka sauerkraut)  

and even vinegar that contained **postbiotics** and ate the **prebiotic fiber**, their gut microbiome diversity **increased** and their **inflammation** markers **decreased**.  

But **dietary fiber** isn’t the only food source that your **gut buddies** can **ferment** to produce `SCFAs`. Certain specialized **gut buddies** can also make SCFAs, including the most important one, `butyrate`, using the **mucus produced** by the **epithelial cells** lining your gut.  

`Butyrate` is the **sole source** of nourishment for **colon cells**. If there is no butyrate, there will be **no happy colon cells**, **no barrier** to prevent **unwanted** particles and bacteria from getting loose—creating the ideal conditions for **cancer cells** to grow. In just this one example—and there are plenty more to come—**Hippocrates** was right: **all disease begins in the gut**.  

When you have strong, healthy, plentiful **mitochondria** in the cells lining the gut, your gut lining will also be strong and **healthy**! This is precisely how `butyrate` improves and even **repairs** intestinal barrier function.  

Butyrate in particular is not just a **powerful mitochondrial uncoupler**; it also has a widespread **impact** on your **entire** immune system. It tells the `epithelial cells` when to release **pro-inflammatory cytokines** and when not to, which **reduces** chronic inflammation in the gut.   

When your gut is **out of balance** and certain bacteria overgrow, they can degrade `miRNAs` (gene regulators), leading to tumor growth and increased inflammation, among other diseases. On the other hand, if all is peaceful and balanced down in the gut, your **gut buddies** will produce `butyrate`, which, among its other talents, can alter miRNAs to **suppress** the growth of cancer cells.  

One key to maintaining ideal levels of `hydrogen sulfide` (H2S) is to reduce your intake of animal protein. **Restricting** the amino acids derived from animal protein results in balanced H2S production. On the other hand, a diet high in animal protein throws this balance in the **wrong direction**, damaging your precious mucus layer and **disturbing** your microbiome diversity. This is one reason that following a typical **keto diet** may negatively **impact** your longevity plans.  

Would you assume that I was exaggerating if I told you that when they first arrive at my office, **nearly** every one of my patients is suffering from `leaky gut`, also known as intestinal permeability? This condition results from a **breach in the gut wall** that allows harmful compounds to leak into your `bloodstream` and your body. Leaky gut is now an **epidemic**, affecting more people than we’ve ever before imagined. It is both a result of a damaged internal ecosystem and a **contributor** to nearly every **major** disease.  

**Eating anti-inflammatory** foods to quiet inflammation is like fighting a **forest** fire with a **garden** hose! At best, maybe you can tamp down some small amount of inflammation this way, but unless you address the **root** cause, you’ll **never** be able to keep up. The inflammation will just keep coming due to the **root** cause: leaky gut.  

When I measure how a patient `gut wall` is **functioning**, which I can do with `blood tests` that measure leaky gut, such as 
* anti-zonulin IgG (antibodies that target zonulin protein) - regulating intestinal permeability
* anti-actin IgG (antibodies that target actin protein) - component of the cytoskeleton in eukaryotic cells
* anti-LPS (antibodies that target lipopolysaccharides) - endotoxin that can trigger strong immune response

I can **literally** see their **future**. If their gut wall is **intact** and their microbiome is **homeostatic**, they are likely to live a long, healthy, disease-free life. If the gut wall is **permeable**, however, they will almost certainly **suffer** from inflammation, pain, and disease.  

The good news is that it is **entirely possible** to **restore** the gut wall to all of its former glory, **not only reducing** inflammation but also reversing disease in the process.  

Specialized `white blood cells` that make up a full 60 to 80 percent of your **entire immune system** are **positioned** along that **gut lining** like **troops** manning the walls of your **fortress**. They are there so that when something **slips** through the lining that shouldn’t, they will launch into **action** and attack the foreign **invader**.  

How does your immune system know which molecules belong and which do not? Those **immune cells** contain scanning devices called `toll-like receptors` (TLRs), or, as I call them, "tiny little radars", which mediate the immune response. They are like bar code scanners. They **recognize** the **structure** of specific molecules and scan the ones coming through the gut lining to make sure they are **safe**. When a TLR **recognizes** an invader, the immune cell **releases** inflammatory hormones called `cytokines`. These `cytokines` signal to the rest of the immune system that there’s trouble down in the gut and they should be **prepared** to launch an attack, too, if the troublemakers show up in their **vicinity**. In a healthy body, this system works brilliantly. But when your gut is permeable, invaders regularly **end up** in places they shouldn’t be. Your immune system attacks these invaders **over and over** again. And **all** of the cytokines produced **lead** to `widespread inflammation`, the root cause of disease that you now see is really a **symptom** of `leaky gut`. What causes the gut lining to become leaky in the **first place**, triggering all of that inflammation? One culprit is `lectins`, which you’re already familiar with if you’ve read my other books. `Lectins` are a type of **protein** found in many **plants** that evolved as a **defense** mechanism to **keep** the plant or its seeds from being **eaten** 
by **predators**. In response, **we humans** evolved to have our own defense systems: our `microbiome`, which **loves eating lectins**, and `mucus`, not just along our gut lining but also in our nose, mouth, and esophagus. Now, lectins are some of those sticky, **sugar- seeking proteins**. The problem is that many of us don’t have **enough mucus lining** our gut walls. Why not? Because we don’t have the **right mix** of **gut buddies** living in our ecosystems. Remember, you need the `gut buddy Akkermansia` to eat that mucus and produce `butyrate`, which in turn **stimulates** the gut lining cells to **produce** more `mucus`. When we are lacking **homeostasis** in our internal ecosystem, as so many of us **unfortunately** are, we may **not have** enough `Akkermansia` and other `butyrate-producing` bacteria to maintain our gut lining and effectively protect us from **invaders**. Nor do we have the right mix of lectin-eating bacteria to form another defensive line against the **onslaught**. So the `mucus` that we do have gets used up from **constantly** having to bind and trap **so many lectins** and **other outsiders** that are **trying to break through**. The `mucus` that is meant to be a renewable resource begins to **run dry**, leaving us **vulnerable** to **invaders**. It gets even **worse**. Once they get past the now-depleted mucus layer, **lectins can bind with receptors along the gut lining and produce a compound called zonulin**, which **breaks the tight junctions** that hold your gut lining together. What **used to be** a sticky, impenetrable border is now a lot less sticky because of a **lack of mucus**, plus it’s **full of holes** that allow any invader in that wants to get through! The **invaders** can be  
* lectins
* pathogenic bacteria  

or `lipopolysaccharides` which are fragments of cell walls from dead bacteria. Finally, if the wall of the gut has **gaps**, undigested food particles that normally would **never** make it **across** the gut wall without first being broken down and absorbed appear to our immune system to be foreign invaders and are **attacked**, as well.  

This is a fascinating part of your **gut buddies** language and yet another reason that `fermented foods` play such a **critical** role in your health. Most fermented foods contain **dead bacteria** as well as the postbiotic "messages" that the bacteria produced during the fermentation process (back when they were alive, of course). Thus, a recent human study showed that a **diet high** in **fermented** foods dramatically **increases** `microbiota diversity` while **decreasing** inflammatory markers.  

As a quick aside, it is interesting to consider the fact that when fermenting foods containing `lectins` is one of the best ways to **reduce** their **lectin content** so that you can **safely eat** them without damaging your gut wall. During the **fermentation** process, bacteria **eat** the vast majority of those nasty lectins!  

`Autophagy` helps prevent apoptosis from occurring and is a **critical** component of `homeostasis`.  

> The **mitochondria** in your **gut wall** are perhaps the **most important** ones in your body.  

`Glycine` levels typically **decrease** with age, and this leads to  
* elevated oxidative stress
* glutathione deficiency
* mitochondrial dysfunction
* increased inflammation  

This comes as no surprise to me, since we know that **glycine protects the gut** wall and leaky gut is behind all of the diseases we normally **associate with aging**. However, we know that **supplementing** with `glycine` can be very **effective**. In one study, older adults who had severely **elevated** inflammation levels and `endothelial dysfunction` saw great improvements with glycine supplementation. After just two weeks, their `mitochondrial function` improved and they had a **significant** reduction in inflammatory markers.  

Further, `glycine supplements` fully corrected `mitochondrial dysfunction` in patients with HIV. `Glycine` is also a major component of **collagen**. Perhaps this is why collagen can help maintain, reinforce, and repair the gut wall by modulating immune reactions, reducing oxidative stress, and helping distribute and **express** tight-junction proteins. Want one more benefit of more glycine? Taken as a supplement before bed, glycine lowers body temperature and induces high-quality sleep.  

> **nattokinase** does contain various amino acids, including glycine. Glycine is a non-essential amino acid that plays a role in various biological processes, including protein synthesis and the regulation of neurotransmitters. However, the specific amounts of glycine and other amino acids in nattokinase can vary depending on the source and method of extraction.  

`Polyamines` are **organic compounds** that have many jobs in your body, from **aiding** in cell **proliferation** and **differentiation** to acting as **antioxidants**, scavenging the body to **eliminate** free radicals. There are three polyamines:  
* spermine
* spermidine
* putrescine (the last one doesn’t smell great)  

Interestingly, your cells can **make polyamines from amino acids**, but your **gut buddies** actually **make** the majority of them in the `large intestine`.  

They **help** the **cells** along the **gut wall proliferate and differentiate** and simultaneously aid in **developing** the immune system. By helping to shape the immune system and acting as antioxidants, `polyamines` play a **big role** in modulating the inflammatory immune response. By helping cells grow and differentiate, polyamines **help maintain** the gut lining throughout your life.   

> Plastics are ubiquitous. It is **toxic** to the microbiome.  

Today, a full 25 percent of antibiotic prescriptions are considered inappropriate or **unnecessary**, and the **average American** is prescribed a course of antibiotics every **six months**.  

This all happens in adults, yet antibiotics are possibly even more damaging when taken **during pregnancy** and **early childhood**. When an expecting mother takes antibiotics that **alter** her **microbiome**, it **leads** to a **decrease** in the `fetus microbiome diversity`, reduced immunity, and a likelihood of disease **later** in life. Infants who were **exposed** to antibiotics in the **womb** have an increased risk of developing :  
* colitis
* cerebral palsy
* epilepsy
* cardiac
* genital malformations  

They are also more likely to develop asthma, allergies, functional impairments in development and cognition, obesity, and diabetes.  


## GLYPHOSATE
While **we have been destroying** our inner ecosystems by **abusing oral antibiotics**, we have also been **spraying** them on our food. Literally. Glyphosate, the **herbicide** in the weed killer **Roundup**, was patented as an **antibiotic**. It works by **disrupting** the **pathway** that plants use to **produce** amino acids, called the `shikimate pathway`. Plants but not animals use the shikimate pathway. That led **scientists** to assume that glyphosate would **kill weeds** while remaining **safe** for humans and other animals. Makes sense, right?  

Well, not so fast. Guess **who else** uses the `shikimate pathway`? Your **gut buddies**, of course. **Glyphosate** is **lethal** for them, which means that it’s **big trouble** for you. I’ve written about glyphosate in some of my previous books, but there is now new information about and evidence of exactly **how damaging** it is to the `microbiome` and therefore to us. Glyphosate was first introduced to the market in **1974**. Immediately, plants, in all of their wisdom, found a way to evolve and become **resistant** to glyphosate, just as bacteria have with **antibiotics**. By the early **1990s**, `glyphosate-resistant crops` led to a **massive increase** in glyphosate use. Hey, this stuff **isn’t working**. Let’s **use more of it**! Not the smartest idea on the part of **humans**.  

In the years since then, we’ve seen evidence that glyphosate is **dangerous** and **carcinogenic**, but we **didn’t know exactly how it affected the gut**. Then, in **2021**, scientists at King College London conducted a **groundbreaking study** that looked at the effects of **glyphosate** on the **infant microbiome**. They **found** that although **maintaining pH levels** is **key** to gut `homeostasis`, glyphosate **creates** an **acidic environment** that is deadly for some of our **gut buddies** and allows **others** to **overgrow**. Not only does glyphosate **destroy the state of homeostasis**, but unfortunately, some of the bacteria that are the most naturally **resistant to glyphosate** are also the **most harmful**. They have the **potential** to increase the production of `pro-inflammatory cytokines` and reactive oxygen species (ROSs). Compounding this problem, even **low-dose glyphosate exposure** reduces the key enzymes that we need to reduce ROSs, particularly **superoxide dismutase** and **glutathione reductase**. That’s a double whammy in the fight against cellular damage.  

Even worse, some of our **gut buddies** that are most **susceptible** to glyphosate are also the **most essential**. These include : 
* Lactobacillus
* Ruminococcaceae
* Butyricicoccus  

which are **key** producers of `SCFAs`, tryptophan, and **L-glutamate**. You already know how important `SCFAs` are. Tryptophan and L-glutamate are also **essential**, particularly when it comes to your **mental health**. These **amino acids** are **precursors** of many important **neurotransmitters**, including : 
* serotonin
* dopamine
* gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)
* epinephrine  

These are all mood-stabilizing chemicals that our bodies cannot produce without the help of our **gut buddies**.  

So why are **we still using** it? Back in 2017, leaked documents from **Monsanto** (the company, now owned by Bayer, that sells and profits from Roundup) showed that it had created its own research to "prove" that its product was **safe** while covering up **internal disagreements** about its **safety**. Yet it still has **not been banned** in the United States. Two years later, in **2019**, the Environmental Working Group found **glyphosate** in all **twenty-one popular breakfast cereals** that it tested, including several **organic** varieties!!  

## ENDOCRINE DISRUPTERS
In males, `endocrine disrupters` affect **sperm production** and quality, and in females, they **affect conception, pregnancy, and delivery**. They do this by **interacting** with `hormone receptors` by turning them **on or off and by hijacking the signals** that are sent to those `receptors`. Endocrine disrupters can also impact `circulating hormone levels` in the body. They do this by **altering the permeability of the cell membranes** that allow hormones **in and out**. In other words, these `chemicals` direct **where and when** your hormones **should go** and how the rest of your body **should respond** to the **fluctuating** hormone levels. The **impact** that this has on your body is **enormous**. Even `mild hormone imbalances` can lead to everything from :  
* infertility 
* anxiety
* depression
* bone disease
* heart disease
* cancer  

`Endocrine disrupters` make a lot of their mischief by messing with your **gut buddies**’ **signaling molecules**—those uber-important **communication** tools. For one, they **interfere** with the way short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) **signal and modulate** glucose metabolism. We now **believe** that this is the **connection** between `endocrine disrupters` and the increased risk of `diabetes`. They also interrupt the important signals being sent by : 
* neurotransmitters
* cytokines
* hormones  

`Endocrine disrupters` can also create changes to `microbiome composition`, leading to `dysbiosis`. **Certain** types of **gut buddies** are more `vulnerable` than others to specific chemicals, leading to `uniquely dysbiotic makeups`. For example, `BPA` creates changes in the gut **similar** to those of a `high-fat diet`! There go the benefits of your healthy eating. And before you say that you don’t use BPA plastic bottles anymore, BPA **replacements**, such as `BPS` and `BPF`, are **no safer** and have been recently linked to the causation of `hormonal cancer`. **Exposure** to endocrine disrupters can create `dysbiosis` at any time.  

In humans, endocrine disrupters are associated with :  
* polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)
* diabetes, allergies
* asthma
* autoimmune diseases  

They also lead to **decreased expression** of `tight-junction proteins`, **impairing** the `gut wall` and **leading** to `leaky gut`.  

As a little tease of something that I’ll talk about in much greater detail later, your **gut buddies** would much rather you smoke than wear perfume.  

## WHOLE GRAIN GOODNESS
**It wasn’t until 1994** that the **US Department of Agriculture** (USDA) started **defining** for us what was "healthy" to eat, and it was shortly after that, with the support of the **Whole Grains Council**, that it started **encouraging Americans** to eat more **whole grains**. Now, remember that the **USDA job** is to **promote agriculture**, **not health**, yet it is in charge of creating our "healthy" **food pyramid**. That’s the **equivalent** of **putting drug companies** in **charge** of most of the research and education of physicians in the United States, which would be a profound **conflict of interest**. But wait! That’s exactly what **has been done** both with **drugs** and with **food**. The **fox** is clearly **guarding** the **henhouse**.  

Did the USDA ever stop to **wonder** why **ancient civilizations** always **refined** their **grains** through a process called **milling**? Doing so removes the : 
* bran
* germ
* husk  

from the grains.  

The ancient **Romans** are **credited** with being the **first** people to **mill grains**. The process required labor and materials and was expensive, so the use of refined grains became a **status symbol**. Only the **wealthy elite ate white bread**, while **slaves** and members of the lower classes consumed **whole grains**.   

Asian cultures began removing the **bran** from **rice** thousands of years ago to create **white rice**. Until relatively recently, white rice was seen as a **luxury** that was reserved for **society elite**.  

Of course, with **modern scientific techniques** and **measurements**, now we know **exactly** why these foods are healthier—because they are better for our **gut buddies**. That’s right, **despite** everything that we’ve been told about how badly we need whole grains and their fiber and nutrients, refined grains—and, no, **that doesn’t mean highly processed**!—`are much, much better for our gut`.  

So what’s the **problem** with **whole grains**? In a word, `lectins`. One **type** of **lectin** that we are learning more about every day is `wheat germ agglutinin` (WGA). As the name implies, WGA is **part** of the **wheat germ**, which is **removed during milling**. Why bother removing it? Because WGA **binds** to `sialic acid`, part of the **sugary coating** on so **many** of our **cellular surfaces**, including **blood vessels**, the **synovial surfaces** of **joints**, the nearly **impermeable blood-brain barrier**, the **myelin sheath** that encases and **insulates** your **nerves**, and even the **surface** of your **eyeballs**. This coatingis called the `glycocalyx`. Like the **mucus layer** of the **gut lining**, these s**ticky surfaces** are **meant** to **trap invaders** and keep them away from your **delicate blood vessels, nerves, joints**, and other critical parts.  

This is important because `WGA` is an **invader** and acts on the `glycocalyx` as a splinter does on your finger. The problem is, this **small lectin** can **leak** through the **gut barrier** even if you **don’t have leaky gut**. And when you **regularly** consume **whole grains**, as the **USDA wants** you to, this happens **over and over** throughout your body. Of course, this causes your **immune system** to become **overactivated**, leading to **inflammation and disease**.  

A `glycocalyx` protects many, many **parts** of our bodies, and `WGA` can **bind** to each **of them**, prompting an **autoimmune attack** on those tissues. We have seen this in everything from the **vascular endothelial cells** that line our arteries, veins, and capillaries to the `glycocalyx` lining our eyes. Furthermore, because it is so small, **WGA can penetrate the blood-brain barrier**, a layer of `endothelial cells` that protects our **brains** from invaders. This leads to **inflammation** in the `nervous system`. For now, we must understand how harmful the last several decades of "whole grain goodness" have been to our **gut** and nearly every **system in our body**.  


## NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS (NSAIDS) AND PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS (PPIS)  

NSAIDs include:
* Ibuprofen (e.g., Advil, Motrin)
* Naproxen (e.g., Aleve, Naprosyn)
* **Aspirin** (e.g., Bayer)
* Diclofenac (e.g., Voltaren)
* Indomethacin (e.g., Indocin)  

What does this have to do with NSAIDs? To a lesser extent, they do the same thing as DNP. **When they are absorbed** into the gut wall, they cause a **drastic uncoupling of the mitochondria in the wall of your gut** without **stimulating** the **birth** of new mitochondria via **mitogenesis**. The gut lining cells **die from a lack** of `ATP`, and you are **left with holes in your gut** wall—good old leaky gut.  

NSAIDs cause dysbiosis along with 
* bleeding
* inflammation
* ulceration  

in the stomach and small intestine. Within just one hour of an `NSAID` being taken, it creates dose-dependent changes to `mitochondria`. It should come as no surprise, then, that long-term NSAID users have an increased risk of heart disease and stroke.  

Furthermore, NSAIDs **actually exacerbate inflammation**, and not just in the gut. A new study out of the University of California shows that after one year of NSAID treatment for **osteoarthritis**, patients had the **same levels of inflammation**. After four years of treatment, their inflammation was actually **worse**. Of course, when patients continue to **complain** of pain after NSAID treatment, they are often prescribed—you guessed it— **more NSAIDs**!  

If the symptoms caused by the NSAIDs are in the upper GI tract, doctors often prescribe `proton pump inhibitors` (PPIs), which **reduce** stomach acid, but these drugs only cause **further damage**. Like most things in your body, `stomach acid` is there for a reason—in this case, more than one reason. `Stomach acid` is meant to **destroy lectins and protect you from bacteria that shouldn’t get past the stomach**. Remember, an **acidic environment** is **deadly** to bacteria.  

As acids move down the GI tract and the inner ecosystem becomes more and more densely populated, they are naturally **diluted** by the **addition of pancreatic juices and bile**. By the time the **end of the small intestine** is reached, the acid is mostly **neutralized**. This is called the `acid gradient`, and it keeps bacteria from climbing up **higher** into the intestine.  

If PPIs are used to get rid of the acid, there goes the `gradient`, and there’s nothing stopping bacteria from **swimming around into the small intestine**, where they **don’t belong**. This can **lead** to small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (**SIBO**), which often creates problems with immunity. PPI users also have a significantly **reduced abundance** and diversity of **gut buddies** in the lower GI tract and an increased **risk** of **infections** such as C. diff.  

It is now widely known that **these drugs are not safe** to take for long periods of time. It says right on the box that you shouldn’t take them for more than two weeks. Yet I see patients who have been on them for **decades**. Meanwhile, long-term use of PPIs is associated with an increased risk of developing : 
* dementia
* pneumonia
* kidney disease
* heart disease
* reduced bone density  

This is, **sadly**, what happens when scientists look at the human body through a **narrow lens**. Your **gut buddies** and the inner workings of your gut in general are a beautiful example of how everything is connected and, when left interrupted, works together in perfect **harmony**. When **one element** of the system is disrupted, it **all falls apart**.  

## MICROPLASTICS
Microplastics **alter microbiome diversity**, create **dysbiosis**, and impact **gut barrier function**. Exposure **increases** the **abundance of bacteria** that are associated with respiratory **diseases** (Klebsiella and Helicobacter) and digestive tract **diseases** (Bifidobacterium, Streptococcus and Sphingomonas) and reduces the abundance of `beneficial bacteria`, such as Bacteroides, Ruminococcus torques group, Dorea, Fusobacterium, and Coprococcus. And when microplastics are **ingested**, they can **accumulate** in the **intestines**, injuring `epithelial cells` and creating **toxic effects**. Worse yet, they **cross** the **placenta** into the bodies of **unborn babies**.  

The people whom the government **have put in charge** of `our health` seem to believe that microplastics are too small to make a significant difference. But as we’ve now seen, it is the little things that truly have the **biggest impact** on our health and well-being.  

## MOLECULAR MIMICRY AND AUTOIMMUNITY
Α **dysfunctional gut wall** allows invaders such as lectins, lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), undigested "normal" food particles, and bad bugs to sneak **through** the gut barrier and into your **bloodstream**, where they do **not** belong. The `toll-like receptors` (TLRs) on your **immune cells** recognize the invaders as foreign and respond by sending a signal **to the rest** of your immune system, telling it to **stay on high alert** and launch an **attack**. The result is **inflammation**, that old "root cause" of **disease**. As a reminder, `short-term inflammation` isn’t a bad thing. Inflammation is part of the immune response for a reason: it’s a result of the **flood of white blood cells** swooping into the site of an infection or damage to **help** you heal. There are certainly times when you need that. The problem is that when you have `leaky gut` and your body is **constantly** responding to invaders, your body becomes `perpetually inflamed`. This **sets** the **stage for disease**.  

Plants don’t want you to eat them or their seeds, which are their babies. So they incorporate defensive proteins called `lectins`. As you learned earlier, if these `lectins` get past your defenses of stomach acid, the `microbiome`, and the `mucus`, they can attach to your **gut wall**, **flip** a few switches, and create **gaps** in the wall that they can **pass through**.  

## Lectins
The proteins **on and in** many of our organs, nerves, blood vessels, and joints share similar molecular patterns. So when `lectins` are **constantly seeping** through a `leaky gut` (or when you consume WGA, which is small enough to get through the gut wall **even if it’s intact**!) and you have `lipopolysaccharides` (LPSs) constantly **putting your immune system on high alert**, your immune system begins to **view parts** of your own **body** as these **invaders** and **attacks them, too**. When the immune system attacks the body, it’s called an `autoimmune disease`. Once a `leaky gut` is **sealed**, the immune system begins to **calm down** and is no longer **on guard** against those particular invaders. So it **stops attacking** anything that looks like them.  

As I reported at the American Heart Association in 2018, 94 percent of patients with autoimmune diseases (as proven by blood markers) **were cured** or in remission within **nine months** of following my `Gut Check program`.  

Remember, the gut **isn’t** the only **home of bacteria** in our bodies. As I mentioned earlier, our `oral microbiome` is also incredibly important. Our `oral mucosa` functions very much **like** the **gut wall** to **keep bacteria out** of our bloodstream. When the oral microbiome is **out of balance** and **bad bugs** are able to **access our bloodstream** that way, they can cause just as **much damage** as they do when they enter through the rest of your **gut**.  

A recent study looked at the **oral microbiomes** of patients with `rheumatoid arthritis`, an autoimmune disease that affects millions of Americans. It showed that patients with `rheumatoid arthritis` were more likely to have `periodontal disease` than healthy people were. In fact, patients with rheumatoid arthritis had **high numbers of bacteria** from their oral microbiome **in their bloodstream**! They also had **high levels of inflammatory immune cells** in their bloodstream during **flares**. All of these signs point to the `leaky mouth` and molecular **mimicry theories** of autoimmune disease.  

## LEAKY GUT = LEAKY HEART
`Lectins` are **sugar-seeking** proteins. They attach to **sugar molecules** made of **sialic acid** in the **gut lining**. This is **why you have the mucus layer**: to trap and protect you from invaders such as `lectins` before they can bind **to your gut wall and pop it open**.  

Your gut lining **isn’t the only surface** in your body that’s lined with **sugar molecules**. You also have them along your :
* blood vessels
* joints
* the junctions between your nerves
* the coating over your nerves
* your eyeballs  

and even, as I’ll discuss later, in the `blood-brain barrier` that **protects** your **brain**. These **coatings** are collectively known as the `glycocalyx`. One such glycocalyx is the thin layer of **polysaccharides** and **lipids** that forms a `protective layer` overlaying the surface of your blood vessels `endothelial cells`. Its coating is **similar** to the **mucus** overlaying the `endothelial layer` of the gut. When you have a `leaky gut` that allows `lectins` to get through the gut lining, they can **bind** to and **damage the lining**.  

So now there is a **splinter stuck** against the wall of your blood vessel, sticking out like a **sore thumb**. The `immune system` in your blood jumps into action and **attacks** the splinter, **leading** to inflammation and eventually an **attack** on the blood vessels themselves. Lo and behold, this leads to `arteriosclerosis`, the heart disease that, like all others, is really an **autoimmune disease**.  

Remember, `WGA` is such a small lectin that it can get past the gut wall **without leaky gut**. And it doesn’t stick just to blood vessels; it sticks to and actually goes through the `blood-brain barrier`, along with LPSs. And it binds to the surface of your eyes.  
-Dry, itchy eyes, anyone? 
Thank your sandwich with **whole wheat bread** for that. And oh, yes, WGA **binds** to **cartilage**. Hip or knee replacement, anyone?  

Sure enough, patients with `atherosclerosis` have reduced levels of `butyrate-producing bacteria` to **protect** their **gut linings**. This leads to higher **circulating levels** of LPSs and `zonulin`, the protein that **increases intestinal permeability**. But when `mice` were fed a high-butyrate diet for ten weeks, the atherosclerosis in their aortas was reduced by 50 percent. Further evidence of the `leaky gut/leaky heart` connection comes from `intestinal alkaline phosphatase` (IAP), which is secreted by your `enterocytes`. As you recall, IAP detoxifies LPSs and **helps keep them from entering** the bloodstream. When mice were given human IAP, they had a significant **reduction** in `atherosclerosis`. Still not convinced that **atherosclerosis stems** from the gut? In recent years, many studies have found bacterial DNA in atherosclerotic plaques. Remember what contains bacterial DNA? LPSs that have **slipped through** a leaky gut, of course!  

Furthermore, people with `oral dysbiosis` are likely also to have `gut dysbiosis`. Perhaps one too many **minty gargles** with that bacteria-killing mouthwash? In addition to LPSs, **oral bacteria** have **been found** in **heart valves**, aortic aneurysms, and arterial walls. In other words, `leaky mouth = leaky heart`, too!  

By now, you may be wondering, What about `cholesterol`? I thought that was what caused `heart disease`. This is what **we’ve all been told**, but it’s simply **not true**. Because scientists found `cholesterol` stuck to the `blood vessels` in patients with `heart disease`, many doctors and researchers **wrongly believed** (and the majority of them still believe) that `cholesterol` had **caused the plaque**. But this is just **like** assuming that all of these various diseases cause `leaky gut`!  

How did we get it so wrong? In reality, **when** blood vessels are **inflamed**, `cholesterol particles` come along and **act** as a **spackling compound**, **covering up areas of inflammation** or **gaps** along the `glycocalyx`. A study in 2023 confirmed that `cholesterol` has **nothing** to do with `heart disease`; heart disease stems from inflammation in your blood vessels caused by `leaky gut`. Want more proof? A study in March 2023 involving more than 31,000 subjects showed that `statin` drugs, even if they dramatically lowered cholesterol levels, had no effect on `plaque progression` or on **heart attacks** and death. Rather, the **driver** was **inflammation**, as measured by high- sensitivity `C-reactive` protein (hs-CRP) and `tumor necrosis factor alpha` (TNF alpha) tests, two tests that I routinely do in my clinics.  

For a real-life example of this, let’s look at a tale of two of my patients: I have one patient who’s **sixty-eight years** old and is the administrator at a large medical clinic here in the desert. He’s not overweight, but he has extremely **high cholesterol levels**. When he came to see me, his low-density lipoprotein (LDL)—the so-called bad cholesterol—level was a whopping `400 mg/dl`. Most doctors will tell you that your LDL should be **below 100 mg/dl**, so that was a significant—and scary—number. All of that patient previous doctors had **insisted** that he go on `statin drugs` to lower his cholesterol, but he didn’t **tolerate** them very well. So he wanted to find another way to assess his real risk, and his cardiologist had him take a computerized `tomography angiogram` (CTA, as opposed to a CT calcium score, which only looks at calcium deposits in coronary arteries). A CTA shows a beautiful three-dimensional reconstruction of the coronary arteries, and—wait for it—it revealed that this patient **had zero plaque** in his arteries. None. His blood vessels were as smooth as a baby’s butt. And since you waited for it, guess what his cardiologist response was? Of course, his cardiologist responded to the revelation by saying that he should `start taking statins` in order to avoid **developing plaques**! When that patient came to me, I explained that by looking at the **blood work** I had ordered, I could have predicted his **angiogram findings**. He had no inflammation in his blood vessels, nor did he have any markers of `cholesterol oxidation` ([Οξειδωμένη Χοληστερίνη LDL](https://eshop.athenslab.gr/exetaseis-prolipsis/oxeidomeni-xolisterini-ldl-1295) (oxLDL)) [[2](https://testdirectory.questdiagnostics.com/test/test-guides/TS_oxLDL/oxidized-ldl)]. That meant that his high cholesterol levels did **not put him** at risk for developing `heart disease`. There was **no inflammation** on the blood vessels for the cholesterol to stick to or spackle over.  

Furthermore, `cholesterol` has to be oxidized (or activated) in order to stick to blood vessels in the first place. `Oxidative stress` can oxidize LDL (hence the name), making it "sticky". But that patient had been following a `high polyphenol` diet and had a **healthy gut**, so he had no inflammation or oxidation to worry about. Now compare this to another patient of mine, who had recently been put on a **high dose** of `statins` by his well-meaning practitioner to get his LDL very, very low. His LDL was down to a mere **37 mg/dl**, but, to his chagrin, when we looked at his blood work, the particles were **extremely oxidized**. He had **inflamed arteries**, and—big surprise—**severe arterial plaques**. Lo and behold, he had **all the markers of leaky gut**, while the other one didn’t.  

Just as in the recent study I mentioned above, all of the `statin-induced` LDL lowering in the world wasn’t the answer to his problem; it was addressing his leaky gut that would make the difference. How did I know? I study my patients and publish my results. For instance, in 2018, I demonstrated that `dietary lectins` cause `coronary artery` disease by prompting an **autoimmune attack** on blood vessels. Furthermore, in nearly a **thousand patients** with known `coronary artery` disease and **plaques** whom I followed for a mean of **nine years** on the **Gut Check program** the total new `cardiovascular` events were **1.6 percent**. **Contrast** that to the typical **10 to 20 percent of new events** at five to ten years of follow-up with maximal medical therapy (including statins). To be clear, I have nothing against using `statins` as a temporary **intervention**. They can **indeed limit damage** to blood vessels, but they do it in a completely different way than most patients—and doctors themselves, for that matter—realize. `Statins` actually block `toll-like receptors` (TLRs), the scanners on your immune cells that **recognize invaders** and tell your immune system to attack. As a result, they **reduce inflammation** along the arteries, hopefully leaving nowhere for `cholesterol` to attach itself to.  

But it’s not just `atherosclerosis`. Changes in the `gut microbiota` and its metabolites result in increased levels of **circulating LPSs** that are related to :
* myocardial infarction
* heart failure
* atrial fibrillation
* hypertension 

**Patients** with every one of these **conditions** have **dramatically reduced microbial richness** and diversity in their **guts** and especially low levels of those all-important `butyrate-producing` bacteria. This is **not a case** of heart disease causing gut dysbiosis! For evidence of this, consider the fact that when germ-free mice were given fecal transplants from humans with hypertension, they developed hypertension. I am grateful for the fact that many of my colleagues finally seem to be getting a clear picture of what’s really causing heart disease. In recent years, many studies have concluded that `heart disease` is the **result** of `gut dysbiosis` and **decreased** levels of `butyrate-producing bacteria`, leading to a `dysfunctional gut barrier` that allows :
* LPSs
* lectins 

and even bacteria to **leak into** the bloodstream, bind to TLRs, and **trigger inflammation**. Another mic drop moment! The point is, if you or a loved one has any of these "heart" conditions, the place to look for the cause and treatment is not in the chest—**it’s in the gut**!  

## LEAKY GUT = LEAKY JOINTS = LEAKY METABOLISM
At the risk of sounding redundant, `leaky gut` is also at the root of `osteoarthritis`, as well as obesity, which is thought by many to be the primary risk factor behind this degenerative `joint disease`. In this case, invaders slip through a `leaky gut` and bind to the **lining** that is **meant** to **protect the joints**, leading to **inflammation** and **disease**. Patients with `osteoarthritis` in their **knees** have increased levels of LPSs—and the worse their condition, the **more LPSs they have**. A lack of `vitamin D` **causes** changes to the `microbiome` and `leaky gut`, which leads to inflammation and `osteoarthritis`. Study showed that a combination of **tamarind seed** and **turmeric**, both `polyphenols`, reduced knee pain, inflammation, and cartilage degradation in patients with osteoarthritis in their knees.  

People with **obesity** have an **altered ratio** between the two main phyla of bacteria in our guts: `Firmicutes` and `Bacteroidetes`. These two phyla make up about 90 percent of the bacteria in our guts.   

When otherwise **healthy women** with `vitamin D deficiency` were given vitamin D supplements, their microbiome diversity **significantly increased**, and the ratio between `Firmicutes` and `Bacteroidetes` improved. That helped them shift away from an "obesity microbiome" and **closer** to a state of `homeostasis`.  

Your **gut buddies** send **messages** directly to your `brain`, telling it **when** and **what** you need to eat—or, more accurately, what they **need to eat**. If **bad guys** have `hijacked` this messaging system, they will **send** the signal for you to eat more `sugar` because it’s their **fuel of choice**, leading you to crave **sugary foods**. Yes, they **not only control your hunger and appetite** but control what **foods** you actively **seek** out. No wonder your appetite sometimes feels out of control.  

Scientists recently discovered that Japanese patients with type `2 diabetes` even had significantly more **gut bacteria in their blood**—yes, in their blood! versus than people without type 2 diabetes. The bacteria **had translocated from the gut to the bloodstream**!  

## LEAKY GUT = LEAKY BONES
When I tell my patients with `osteopenia` (reduced bone density) or `osteoporosis` (a more severe case of bone loss) that there is a **gut issue** behind these bone conditions, they generally **look at me as though I’ve lost my mind**. But it’s true that even our **bones** are ultimately at the **mercy of our gut**. There are `immune cells` in our `bones` just as there are in our `body tissues`, with `toll-like receptors` (TLRs) that recognize `lipopolysaccharides` (LPSs) and other **invaders** and activate `inflammatory cytokine` release. It’s the same old story, just **sung****** in a slightly **different** key.  

## THE GUT/CANCER CONNECTION
Even `cancer` ties right back to **leaky gut**. Patients with `colon cancer` have **dysbiosis**, reduced microbiome diversity and richness, and **increased intestinal permeability**, leading to **chronic inflammation**. More and more studies **point** to the `microbiome role` in the development of many other **types of cancers**, too, through its **influence** on the immune system. With `dysbiosis` and `leaky gut`, invaders can seep through the gut wall and **trigger inflammation** that makes it easier for `cancer cells` to **grow**, and **bad guys** can take over your **microbiome** and **enact** damage that results in `oncogenesis` (the birth of cancer cells). One of the ways they do this is by **altering** the **signals** that tell your immune system whether or **not to allow** the cancer cells to reproduce and grow.  

## Leaky Gut = Leaky Brain
Now that you better understand the **importance** of maintaining the sugary **linings protectin**g our gut as well as other important parts of our bodies, it’s time to look at one more sugar lining that is critical to preserving your health: the `glycocalyx` that lines the blood vessels going into your brain.  

The `blood-brain barrier` (BBB) is the **gateway** to your brain and your `central nervous system` (CNS). As the name implies, it is there to **prevent** microorganisms and other foreign proteins from **gaining access** to this **valuable real estate**. Like your `gut wall`, the BBB has a layer of `endothelial cells` lined up next to one another. These cells **regulate** passage through the BBB and into the `nervous system`. And just like your blood vessels elsewhere, these cells are **guarded by a thin layer of sugars and lipids** called the `glycocalyx`. The BBB also contains `pericytes`, cells that destroy **potentially** harmful microorganisms, and `astrocytes`, cells that recruit **white blood cells** into the CNS through the BBB. These two types of cells are **additional lines** of **defense** to protect your `nervous system`.  

On the other side of the BBB are `microglia`, the main white blood or **immune cells** of the `CNS`. The `microglia` are on **constant alert for bad bugs** or other intruders and are there to destroy any that they find—or even suspect. Think of them as the **bodyguards** of your **rock star neurons**. The BBB functions very **similarly** to the `gut lining` with its own `mucus` covering. The `endothelial cells` can **grant access** to nutrients, passing them through the cell body and across the barrier. But microbes, proteins, and most drugs are normally **barred from access**. If `microbes` get through the `endothelial cells` and exit on the other side, they come into contact with the pericytes, astrocytes, and microglia. With all of these lines of **defense** in place, the BBB should provide you with plenty of **protection** from all types of invaders.  

But just **as** with the `gut wall`, there are several ways the BBB can be **breached**. Some invaders, such as the bad bug `E. coli`, are able to bind to the receptors on `endothelial cells` and **pass through** these cells and across the BBB. But in general, the `glycocalyx` must be **damaged** in order for this to happen. And—surprise, surprise—that nasty `lectin WGA` that is **present** in `whole grains` is **perfectly capable of completing this damaging process**.  

In fact, `WGA` can facilitate crossing of the BBB! And don’t forget about those `LPSs`. They, too, **open the gates across the BBB**. So if you have `LPSs` and `WGA` on the loose, the "force fields" guarding your brain are **literally down**, leaving your normally protected brain **open and vulnerable to attack**. A `permeable BBB` also leaves your entire nervous system more **vulnerable**. Indeed, in the case of `multiple sclerosis` (MS), an altered BBB allows various immune cells to **infiltrate the CNS**, leading to inflammation and injury to the `myelin sheath` that protects the `nerves`. No surprise, patients with MS tend to have `altered microbiomes`, with a reduction in `butyrate-producing` bacteria.  

Another way that invaders infiltrate the BBB is via the so-called `Trojan horse` method. In this case, a `pathogenic invader` infects a `white blood cell` that has been recruited into the CNS via the BBB and **piggybacks across**. They sure are **clever**! It seems that for **each** line of **defense**, invaders **have developed a new strategy to break through** the BBB. In case you are **wondering** (you are, aren’t you?), there are **blood tests** that can **measure the breakdown** of the BBB and test you for `leaky brain`.  

## THE BRAIN-GUT AXIS
So the BBB is pretty important. How can we protect it? By having the right **gut buddies** and avoiding `WGA`, of course! We now know that the `microbes` in our guts regulate the BBB in a number of different ways. One is via the `vagus nerve`, the main nerve of the `parasympathetic nervous system`, which plays an important role in :  
* mood
* immune response
* digestion
* heart rate  

Just like your `gut biome`, the `vagus nerve` is essential in maintaining `homeostasis`. It runs all the way from the gut to the brain, and your **gut buddies** use it like a telephone **wire** along which to **send signals upstairs** about what’s going on **down in the gut**. These signaling molecules include various :  
* metabolites
* neurotransmitters
* gasotransmitters
* hormones  

They tell your immune system **whether or not to attack intruders** and **instruct** your `brain` how to **think, feel, and act**. The signals travel in **both directions**, but roughly **90 percent of them are sent up from the gut to the brain** instead of the other way around. Remind me again who’s really in charge?  

I think it’s fair to conclude that a `happy gut` equals a **happy brain**—in addition to a happy, healthy body, of course. When you have the right mix of **gut buddies**, they send messages up the `vagus nerve` saying that everything is **going well**: the immune system can stand **down**, your nervous system can **relax**.   

With `leaky gut` and/or `dysbiosis`, on the other hand, invaders can begin **seeping** through the BBB while your gut sends the message along the `vagus nerve` that you are **under attack**. In this case, **instead** of **battening down** the **hatches** and reinforcing its line of defense, the BBB becomes **more and more permeable**, allowing more invaders in, while the brain and the entire nervous system become more and more **inflamed**. This is the **environment** in which `neurodegenerative diseases can thrive`, along with depression, anxiety, and other mood disorders.  

`Butyrate` not only protects the BBB but also enhances `cholinergic neurons`, which play an important role in brain function and release an essential **neurotransmitter**, `acetylcholine`. `Butyrate` can also **cross** the BBB and activate the `vagus nerve` and the `hypothalamus`, and it has been shown to have **antidepressant effects** in animals with depression and mania.  

`Postbiotics` are neurotransmitters, which send **signals between neurons**. That’s right,  your **gut buddies** play a large **role** in **determining** the levels of **neurotransmitters** in your `brain`, which directly impacts your `cognitive function`.  

Since some `neurotransmitters` cannot cross the BBB, your **gut buddies** send their `precursors` to the brain instead. These are the raw materials needed to produce those `neurotransmitters`. In the brain, your neurons and `glial cells` pair these `precursors` with other `enzymes` to `synthesize neurotransmitters`. Interestingly, your **gut buddies** can produce the **same enzymes** and use them to `produce neurotransmitters` in the gut, too.  

Wait a minute; why do your **gut buddies** bother producing `neurotransmitters` when they cannot cross the BBB? To **act locally** on the **millions of neurons in the gut**, of course! Though many researchers have taken to calling the gut the `second brain`, I would argue that it `actually comes first`. In fact, there are **more neurons in your gut than there are in your entire spinal cord**. Talk about a `gut feeling`! The neurons in the gut are connected to the ones in your brain, and the `neurotransmitters` made in the gut also **act as fast signals** to the brain via the `vagus nerve`. This is another way that your **gut buddies** alter brain `chemistry` and influence your mood and behavior.  

Like most `immune cells`, the `microglia` that are in charge of brain development and `synapse regulation` respond to signals from your **gut buddies**.  

Simply put, a more `balanced microbiome` leads to `improvements` in cognition, brain function, and emotional well-being.  

## Glutamate
`Glutamate` is the most abundant `excitatory neurotransmitter`, meaning that it prompts `neurons` to share information with one another. It is responsible for sending signals between `nerve cells` and is involved in `neuroplasticity`, learning, and memory. Neurons and `astrocytes` can make `glutamate` using metabolites produced by your **gut buddies** as `precursors`. Cells in the `intestinal tract` can also produce `glutamate` and use it to send rapid signals to the brain via the `vagus nerve`. Glutamate has a **direct impact** on your **mental health**. Altered levels of glutamate in :  
* plasma
* serum
* cerebrospinal fluid
* brain tissue  

are **associated** with mood changes, psychotic disorders, and even the **risk** of suicide. Now, don’t panic. Once you have the right **gut buddies** in place, they will help maintain healthy levels of `glutamate` in your brain and your gut.  

## Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA)
Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is an `inhibitory neurotransmitter`, meaning that it **blocks** messages from being sent from one neuron to another. It **counterbalances** the action of `glutamate`, and having a low level of `GABA` is linked to depression and mood disorders. In the brain, `GABAergic neurons` produce an **enzyme** that converts `glutamate` into `GABA`. Therefore, healthy levels of `glutamate` are necessary to have healthy levels of `GABA`. Other metabolites produced by **gut buddies**, including the **SCFA acetate**, are also a **part of** the `GABA` production **process**. These can cross the BBB into the `hypothalamus` so that GABA **can be produced in the brain**.  

## Acetylcholine
Acetylcholine sends excitatory signals between neurons. 40 It is produced by several bacteria, 41,42 but it cannot cross the BBB and luckily can also be synthesized by neurons. 43 However, even the acetylcholine made in the brain is dependent on your **gut buddies**. As I mentioned earlier, butyrate enhances the neurons that produce it! Without the right **gut buddies** producing butyrate, those neurons cannot produce adequate acetylcholine.  

## Dopamine
Earlier, you read about how the single-celled organism toxoplasma hijacks dopamine production in rodents to make them less risk averse. Well, your **gut buddies** play a big role in your dopamine levels, too. Dopamine and dopamine receptors are widely distributed in the intestinal tract, and more than half of the dopamine in the body is produced by the gut.
Patients with depression have reduced transmission and uptake of dopamine. 48 Plus, your gut’s relationship with dopamine is bidirectional: your **gut buddies** produce dopamine, and your dopamine levels affect gastric secretion, motility, and mucosal blood flow.  

## Serotonin
Serotonin is considered to be the key neurotransmitter to the gut-brain axis, as it affects the birth of new neurons that express both dopamine and GABA. Abnormal expression and function of serotonin in the brain are associated with depression and anxiety disorders. 51 Proper levels of tryptophan, an amino acid that is a precursor of serotonin, are also critical to mental health. When patients with depression who had been in remission experienced a temporary reduction in their tryptophan level, their symptoms returned.   

Approximately 90 percent of the serotonin in the body is produced outside the brain, primarily in the intestinal epithelium. Spore-forming bacteria promote this process by producing a metabolite that signals an increase in gene expression along the tryptophan pathway. Some of your **gut buddies** can even use tryptophan to make serotonin directly! As you read earlier, the glyphosate in the weed killer Roundup targetsthose **gut buddies**’ health. And since it is routinely sprayed on most wheat, corn, soy, canola, and oats in North America (yes, even non-GMO crops), many researchers believe that all of the healthy “whole grain goodness” is delivering more and more Roundup right to our gut.   

## Leaky Gut = Leaky Hormones
Another complex and fundamental way in which your **inner ecosystem controls** your health and well-being is through your **endocrine system**, a **delicate balance** of hormones that **circulate** through your bloodstream, sending messages that **regulate** your organs and many of your **bodily functions**. The importance of having the right balance of hormones cannot be overstated, and, as I hope you have now come to expect, your **gut buddies** play many different **essential roles** in **producing, balancing, and metabolizing your hormones**. With `leaky gut` and `dysbiosis`, however, `microbiome-driven` changes to circulating hormone levels can have **massive consequences for your health**. We see this most dramatically with the three main sex hormones— testosterone, progesterone, and estrogen—as well as the stress hormone cortisol. In fact, so **intertwined** are your hormones and your microbiome that there is a whole new field of study called `microbial endocrinology`.  

## THE GUT/HORMONE SYMBIOSIS
The preceding chapter should have you convinced that your `hormones` and your `microbiome` have a **bidirectional** relationship. Your **gut buddies** affect your **hormone levels**, and your hormone levels can also **exert direct changes to your microbiome**. For instance, scientists have known for decades that the hormone `progesterone` promotes the growth of the `Bacteroides genus` of bacteria, and we now know that changes to the `microbiome` also affect `progesterone` levels. In women, a **low progesterone** level can lead to :   
* infertility
* irregular menstruation
* anxiety
* depression  

whereas a **high progesterone** level can cause anxiety and depression, along with weight gain and fatigue. We rely on a balanced `inner ecosystem` to keep these levels in check. Meanwhile, when men’s **testosterone** level goes down, it leads to changes in their `microbiome`. At the same time, certain bacteria **promote testosterone metabolism** and **reabsorption** in the colon. This is an important part of regulating testosterone levels.  

Women need **testosterone**, too. If their testosterone level is **too low**, they might experience the same symptoms as men do. When their **testosterone level is too high**, symptoms such as excess body hair, balding, infertility, and voice deepening can occur. A **high testosterone** level can also contribute to and/or be a consequence of `polycystic ovary syndrome` (PCOS). And since `progesterone` is a **precursor** of `testosterone`, it’s essential to have adequate levels of `progesterone`, too.  

But the `microbiome` has perhaps the most direct and impactful relationship with the hormone `estrogen`. In men, the **symptoms** of too much or too little estrogen are similar to each other. They include sexual dysfunction, infertility, and depression. Another common symptom of a `high estrogen level` in men is **enlarged breast tissue**, technically called `gynecomastia` but better known as "man boobs", something that I see all too often in my patients these days. And wouldn’t you know it, gynecomastia **correlates** with the serum level of `phthalate` (a major endocrine disrupter found in **plastics** and chicken) in **boys**.  

In women, the `estrogen` level naturally decreases after `menopause`. In `premenopausal` women, **low** estrogen can lead to brittle bones, irregularmenstruation, weight gain, dry skin, and thinning hair. When the estrogen level is too **high**, women can experience headaches, worsening premenstrual symptoms, weight gain, and fatigue.  

The `estrogen` level directly **impacts the gut**, too. As you may know, when their estrogen level naturally rises during pregnancy, women experience **rapid changes** to their `microbiomes`. Perhaps not surprisingly, **premenopausal** women have a distinctly different microbiome makeup from men, but **postmenopausal women** have a microbiome that is more **similar to men**. There is plenty of evidence that this is caused by the decreased estrogen level in postmenopausal women. To be sure, `estrogen` itself has **positive effects** on the `microbiome`. It can help reduce `gut permeability` and therefore LPS circulation. As women go through menopause and their estrogen level decreases, they often experience **greater intestinal permeability**, which (no surprise) leads to an **increase in inflammation**.  

Since the relationship between the `microbiome` and `hormones` is bidirectional, these changes to the microbiome during menopause can further alter women hormone levels. If you’re starting off with an `intact gut wall` and a **well-balanced microbiome**, your **gut buddies** will help manage this process for you. Otherwise, it can become a **vicious cycle** of `dysbiosis` leading to **imbalanced hormone levels**, leading to greater `dysbiosis`, leading to even more `imbalanced hormone` levels! This leaves you more susceptible to obesity, metabolic syndrome, endometriosis, and even certain types of cancer.  

## THE ESTROBOLOME
We tend to think of `estrogen` as a "woman hormone", and it does play an important role in women, particularly during their childbearing years. However, **men** have (and need) estrogen, too. In women, estrogen **main job** is to **tell** the cells to **store fat** in case of an upcoming **pregnancy**. **This is why excess estrogen** in men **leads** to 'man boobs' and often a pregnant- looking belly. It also **regulates** the `menstrual cycle` and affects the reproductive tract, urinary tract, heart, blood vessels, bones, breasts, skin, hair, mucous membranes, pelvic muscles, and, last but definitely not least,the **brain**. In **men**, `estrogen` also plays an important role in `sexual function` and the production of `sperm`. It’s clear that **having the right amount of estrogen is important**, but most people **don’t realize** that the `microbiome` directly **regulates** the levels of estrogen in the body. We have known since the 1980s that the **use of antibiotics** leads to a **reduction** in `estrogen` level, and in recent years we have begun to more fully understand how this occurs. Now we refer to the `estrobolome`, the group of recently **discovered bacteria** in the `microbiome` whose products are capable of **metabolizing** and `modulating estrogen`.   

`Estrobolome dysbiosis`, which leads to altered levels of `glucuronidase` and therefore changes to estrogen levels, is in fact **behind many diseases**. For example, increased estrogen **leads** to **altered mitochondrial** and immune system **function**, which is **common** in women with `endometriosis`. Lo and behold, increased estrogen exposure can stimulate the development and progression of `endometriosis`. However, perhaps the greatest danger of `estrobolome dysbiosis` is an increased risk of **developing** cancer. Of course, any **type of dysbiosis increases the risk of developing cancer**.  

## XENOESTROGENS
Complicating matters, there are endocrine disrupters—the chemicals I discussed earlier that mimic or interfere with the body hormones—in many of our everyday products including :  
* plastic bottles
* the liners of metal food cans
* detergents
* flame retardants
* toys
* cosmetics
* pesticides

and even foods.  

`Endocrine disrupters` don’t impact only the exposed individual; they can create `epigenetic` changes that a`lter gene expression` and lead to `transgenerational consequences`. Here’s one example that’s extremely compelling, albeit somewhat extreme. In **1976**, a chemical factory explosion in Italy exposed nearby residents to an endocrine disrupter called `dioxin`. The exposed women experienced **decreased fertility**—as did their daughters who had been exposed in `utero`! One major category of `endocrine disrupters` is `xenoestrogens`, which can **bind** to `estrogen receptors` and change the **expression of estrogen**- related `genes`. As you can imagine, when xenoestrogens **mimic** estrogen in the body and bind to estrogen receptors, it can dramatically increase the risk of **developing estrogen receptor–positive cancer**. This means that even if your `microbiome` and `estrobolome` are in perfect balance, you still might be at risk because of high levels of `circulating xenoestrogens`. Of course, if you’re starting out with `leaky gut` and `dysbiosis`, your risk is **even higher**.  

## Nonylphenols (NPs)
These toxic substances are used in various industrial processes and are found in consumer laundry detergents, personal hygiene products, automotive products, latex paints, and lawn care products. They exhibit estrogen-like activity on estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer cells and have been found in human breast milk, blood, and urine. Again, check those ingredient labels. These things are hiding in many places.  

## Bisphenol A (BPA)
Believe it or not, BPA was first used as a pharmaceutical estrogen back in the 1930s. More recently, it has been used to manufacture certain plastics. It is found in food containers, water bottles, and other protectivecoatings. It should come as no surprise that something that was developed to mimic estrogen in the body actually mimics estrogen in the body! BPA disrupts estrogen receptor activity by mimicking, enhancing, or inhibiting the activity of natural estrogens. Its use is strongly correlated with an increased risk of developing breast, prostate, and uterine cancers.   

## Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT)
DDT is a pesticide that was used for many years across agricultural fields and homes. It is an insect neurotoxin that kills mosquitoes and other insects that carry malaria, typhus, and other diseases. Though it is banned in the United States and some other countries, it is still widely used in places where malaria is endemic, particularly in India and southern Africa. DDT accumulates in adipose tissue and interferes with estrogen receptors. 61 This increases breast and ovarian cancer risk. In men, DDT exposure leads to a decrease in semen volume, concentration, and motility. After DDT was banned, methoxychlor (DMDT) was synthesized as an alternative to protect pets, crops, and livestock from pests such as mosquitoes, cockroaches, and other insects. It inhibits estrogen binding and is also associated with an increase in ovarian cancer risk. After many years of use, DMDT is now banned in both the United States and Europe.  

## Quaternary Ammonium (Chlormequat)
Chlormequat is an herbicide/pesticide that is sprayed on oats and other grains to keep their stalks short so they won’t break or bend in the wind. (I’m not making this up!) It is an endocrine disrupter, as well as being associated with birth defects. It is so dangerous that it is not approved for spraying on food crops in the United States, but in 2018 the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) allowed traces of it to be present in US oats, wheat, and barley. In 2020, the Trump administration further increased the levels permitted in US oats. Recently, the Environmental Working Group (EWG) tested eleven oat products, including several Quaker Oats products, Cheerios, and several granolas, and found that all of them had dangerous levels of this chemical. My advice for many other reasons and now this one is to avoid products containing oats.   

## LONGEVITY AND CHEESE
The people in those locations (GR, IT) eat tremendous amounts of `sheep milk products`, including milk, cheese, and yogurt.  

What the heck is going on with all this `cheese`? Why aren’t all those people suffering from `heart disease` from all that `saturated fat` and `cholesterol`? Well, I’ve already addressed the myths behind `cholesterol`. Further, these `dairy products` are indeed high in `saturated fat`, but it is a **special type** of saturated fat: medium-chain triglycerides (`MCTs`). Sheep, goat, and water buffalo milk contains 30 percent MCTs! MCTs are powerful `mitochondrial uncouplers`.  

People in France, too, eat plenty of sheep cheeses, including Manchego, pecorino, and feta, as well as `A2 casein` cow dairy products. Is it possible that the French remain slim and free of heart disease because of all the cheese they eat and not in spite of it? Is that what’s really at the heart (no pun intended) of the French paradox? I am tempted to say yes.  

The story doesn’t end with `MCTs`, although that alone might be a **good enough reason** to add sheep, goat, and water buffalo dairy products to your diet. The milk from these animals (and products made from them) also contains an additional uncoupling compound called milk fat globule membranes (`MFGMs`), which s**urround the fats** in these milks and make them `soluble`. As `mitochondrial uncouplers`, MFGMs aid in weight loss and insulin resistance. And dare I say that even **Harvard nutritionists** have **trouble** getting around the fact that **consumption** of `high-fat ice cream` reduces **diabetes** risk.  

`Milk products` in and of themselves are clearly **important** for `mitochondrial uncoupling`, but things really start to get interesting when **cheeses are aged—aka fermented**. `Aged cheeses` contain the **important** information from **dead bacteria**, as well as `postbiotics` such as `polyamines`, which, you will recall, are compounds that help **modulate the immune response and protect the gut wall**. `Polyamines` are also `mitochondrial uncouplers`. Perhaps this is why several studies, including a new one out of Sweden, have shown that although consumption of **non fermented milk** and butter is associated with higher all- cause mortality, consumption of **fermented milk** and cheese is associated with lower all-cause mortality.  

Another benefit of `polyamines` is that they increase the activity of intestinal alkaline phosphatase (`IAP`), which, you read earlier, breaks down `lipopolysaccharides` (LPSs) so they can no longer cause you harm. It **turns out that aged cheeses** give you a double whammy of `IAP`. Various components in raw milk and dairy products and the `fermentation` products in cheese all **stimulate** the gut to produce more `IAP`.  

Scratch that; `molded cheeses` actually provide a triple whammy of IAP! Cheeses such as `Roquefort` contain `fungi` that `produce IAP` themselves. Molded cheeses also include additional `metabolites` that `inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis` and **modulate** bacterial growth. As such, they **protect cardiovascular health**.  

All milk contains `MFGMs`, but it’s **only in the milk fat**. Could it be that in our mistaken and now disproven belief in low-fat dairy products, the skim milk we’ve been giving our children, which contains no MFGMs and is mostly sugar, has deprived generations of a slimming, diabetes- fighting substance that long-lived farmers somehow knew was healthy? I highly suggest taking a note from long-lived farmers and consuming plenty of full-fat sheep and goat milk yogurt and cheese, instead of the skim and fat-free varieties.  

## BEANS AND RICE ARE NOT SO NICE
The `sweet potato` is **not** a `regular carbohydrate`; it is a form of `resistant starch`. The name `resistant starch` refers to the fact that it "resists" `quick digestion` and is **not** immediately **converted** into `glucose`. Instead, it makes it **past** your `small intestine` and into your `large intestine` mostly **intact**. Once they arrive in your `large intestine`, `resistant starches` are a **wonderful source of nutrition**, not for you, but for—you guessed it—your **gut buddies**. When they eat `resistant starch`, your **gut buddies** multiply and produce large amounts of the `SCFAs` acetate, propionate, and butyrate.  

`Resistant starches` therefore **increase** your gut buddy **population**, enhance digestion and nutrient absorption, and foster the growth of the **gut buddies** that nurture the all-important `mucus layer` lining your gut. In addition, because they are **not quickly**  digested into `glucose` as other starches are, `resistant starches` don’t raise your **blood sugar** or **insulin levels**. But they do keep you and your **gut buddies** feeling **nice** and **full**.  

In addition to resistant starch, purple (or blue) `sweet potatoes` contain compounds that act as powerful antioxidants. They are also rich in particularly beneficial `polyphenols`, such as `4,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic` acid, that **protect** the `mitochondria` better than do many other `polyphenols`, including the ones in :
* grape skin
* red cabbage
* elderberry
* purple corn
* ascorbic acid  

`Polyphenols` from `sweet potatoes` have also been shown to **suppress the growth of human cancer cells**. But remember, all the `polyphenols` in the world can’t help you if you don’t have the right **gut buddies** to **activate** them.  

It’s clear that these people (Kitavans of Papua New Guinea) protect and nurture their inner ecosystems through the types of `carbohydrates` they eat—`resistant starches`—and the types they don’t—grains and beans. This is just one more piece of the longevity puzzle.  

## GET YOUR FIBER FROM MEAT
On the Greek island of `Ikaria`, it’s common for families to **hunt** for wild **goats** and then consume the meat throughout the year. How do they make the meat last all year? By `fermenting` it! They do the same thing with pigs, which they slaughter during festivals early in the year and then ferment so the meat will last until the next year.  

People in these cultures also make and eat a lot of cured, aka fermented, sausages, which, of course, are popular throughout Europe. In addition to all the other benefits of `fermentation`, this process produces many beneficial compounds, including `cadaverine` helps **prevent cancer**, and those important `polyamines` spermine, spermidine, and putrescine, which (among other things) **help the cells in the gut wall proliferate**.  

> They eat sausages and **sheep cheeses** daily and have the highest life expectancy in the world.  

Unfortunately, it’s the stuff that most of us discard without eating, such as the ligaments, tendons, bones, and cartilage in meat and fish. These actually act similarly to `resistant starch` in your gut: they resist digestion in the small intestine and are **gobbled** up by your **gut buddies** in the `large intestine`. **Salmon skin** and **tendons** and the **ligaments** between `chicken bones` are also good sources of `resistant starch`.  

As a little tease of something I’ll talk much more about later, this is only one reason that **fish** and **chicken** are the `healthiest forms` of animal protein for both you and your **gut buddies**.  

`Turmeric`, which contains the `polyphenol` curcumin, is traditionally used in soups, curries, and tea. Meanwhile, in `Sardinia`, people eat plenty of `high-polyphenol` fruits and veggies, but one particularly powerful source of their polyphenols is `wine`. We already know that moderate `red wine` consumption is good for our **gut buddies** because of its `fermented polyphenols`, but traditional Sardinian Cannonau wine appears to be **even better**. Cannonau are black grapes that grow in Sardinia and have extremely `high levels of polyphenols`. Wines made from Cannonau grapes have two to three times the amount of polyphenols as do other wines!  

On the Greek island of `Ikaria`, people grow wild greens called `horta` in almost every garden and cook it in `olive oil`, giving them a double whammy of `polyphenols`.  

Another hidden source of `polyphenols` in Ikaria is `traditional Greek coffee`. Boiled Greek coffee, called `Elliniko kafe`, has more `polyphenols` and less caffeine **than other types** of coffee, and most Ikarians drink it several times a day. They also eat a lot of polyphenol-rich herbs, including `rosemary` and `oregano`. Finally, the Ikarians eat large amounts of a common weed that grows in sidewalk cracks called `purslane` (a cousin of moss rose or portulaca), which not only is rich in `soluble fiber` but contains high amounts of alpha-linolenic acid (`ALA`). Heart patients who were supplemented with ALA had dramatic reductions in new coronary events compared to those following an American Heart Association low-fat diet.  

Back to `rosemary`: it is also especially popular in `Acciaroli`, a **fishing village** on the **Italian** coast. Locals eat the extraordinarily pungent wild local `rosemary` that grows there every day, including it in almost everything they cook. In addition to being full of `polyphenols`, it was recently learned that it contains `ursolic acid`, which helps regulate the `gut biome`!  

In `Acciaroli`, people don’t just eat this wonderful `rosemary`; they feed it to the animals that they raise and ultimately consume. The same is true of the other long-lived farming communities on the list: they feed their animals tons of local greens and herbs. As I often say, You are what you eat, and you are what the thing you’re eating ate. The small amount of animal protein that long-lived people eat is basically a delivery device for more `polyphenols`. When they **ferment** the meat to make it last, thereby **fermenting** its polyphenols, all the better!  

## Melatonin: It’s Not Just for Sleep
You’re likely familiar with the hormone `melatonin` as a sleep inducer, and, yes, it can help you sleep, but likely not for the reasons that you think. `Melatonin` is one of only **two antioxidants** that act to `protect mitochondria`. It is made in the brain from the amino acid `tryptophan` (which, you will recall, is also a precursor of many important neurotransmitters). However, `melatonin` is also present in many different plant compounds, including leaves, stems, roots, fruits, and seeds. What the heck is melatonin doing in those plants? They don’t need to sleep. It turns out that melatonin is an antioxidant for the plant’s equivalent of `mitochondria`, the `chloroplasts`. Plants produce it to protect themselves and their mitochondrial equivalents, and when we eat those plants, we **reap** the same benefits. But what about sleep? Well, remember the old credo: association does not mean causation. For ages, scientists assumed that `melatonin` induced sleep because they saw that its level goes up at night. However, nighttime is also when m`itochondrial repair` happens. At **night**, we generate `ketones`, which tell our `mitochondria` to repair and make more of themselves. Of course, it’s a good idea to have `melatonin` handy at that time to help clean and spruce up the `mitochondria`! Wouldn’t you know it, many of these long-lived people eat tons of melatonin-rich foods, such as red wine, olive oil, mushrooms, nuts, and spices. This is one more overlooked reason the `Mediterranean` diet is so effective.  

## BASK IN THE SUN
Why is vitamin D so important? As you read earlier, you need adequate vitamin D in order for the stem cells hiding in the crypts of your microvilli to proliferate and replace dead cells along your gut wall. Vitamin D impacts the gut in many other ways, too. A higher vitamin D level leads to increased gut diversity and more butyrate-producing bacteria, corrects the Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio, and increases the abundance of some particularly helpful **gut buddies**, such as Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium. So take a note from these long-lived people and get out in the sunshine, or supplement with vitamin D 3 , the active form of the vitamin. If you’re worried about developing skin cancer, you can always do both. People who take vitamin D supplements have fewer cases of melanoma than those who don’t.   

If, like most people, you don’t live in a climate that provides access to sunshine 365 days a year, you can get your vitamin D from another sourcethat is common in long-lived cultures. You guessed it: dairy products, particularly sheep milk dairy products. According to the British Nutrition Foundation, sheep milk has more than four times the amount of vitamin D as cow milk! This is just one more way that these long-lived people take good care of their **gut buddies** and are rewarded with long, healthy lives.  

## VITAMINS AND CIGARETTES DO MIX
In fact, `smoking` seems to be something that **gives** them more **longevity**, not less. For instance, in `Sardinia`, the men and not the women typically smoke, and the men are the ones who live longer, healthier lives. The same goes for Ikaria, Acciaroli, and Costa Rica.   

How can this be? It turns out that `nicotine` is a powerful `mitochondrial uncoupler`! Perhaps this is why smokers are **famously thin**.  

Don’t get me wrong; **smoking is terrible** for your health, but it’s the delivery device that’s the problem. **Nicotine itself appears to have many health benefits**. A study of 30,000 British doctors showed that smoking **reduced** the incidence of `Parkinson disease` by 30 percent, and other studies have shown a correlation between smoking and a **reduced** risk of developing `dementia`.  

You may be wondering: Even if `nicotine` is an uncoupler, how do these people avoid the health consequences of smoking? The answer lies in the rest of their diet. Tobacco smoking causes mischief because it **induces** `oxidative stress`. In your body, `vitamin C` works to **protect** your cells from that `oxidative stress`. But if you smoke, it’s easy for your store of `vitamin C` to get used up. Then you are left unable to counter the effects of `oxidative stress` from smoking. Pardon the brief detour here, but humans are one of the few animals that can’t make `vitamin C`. `Five enzymes` are needed to convert `glucose` into `vitamin C`, and we have only **four**. Animals that make `vitamin C` have zero `coronary artery` disease. It’s that **protective**.  

Bill Sardi, PhD, who studied `vitamin C` extensively, showed in **rats** how important it is to have adequate levels of vitamin C. When he silenced the fifth enzyme needed to produce vitamin C (the one that humans are lacking), the rats lived half as long as other rats that did not have that gene silenced. But when he added vitamin C to the drinking water of the rats with the silenced gene, they returned to their normal life span. Sardi believed that if humans were to have vitamin C in their diet continuously, they could live for up to 250 years.  

Why can’t our bodies make this all-important vitamin? What happened to the fifth enzyme? One theory is that the mutation that silenced the last enzyme was protective. If you get **plenty** of `exogenous vitamin C` in your diet, as humans in the jungle did, the `glucose` that would go into making it could be put to better use. Evolution tends to favor efficiency. The problem, of course, is that now most of us **don’t get** nearly enough `vitamin C` from our diet to counter the `oxidative stress` in our bodies, whether or not we smoke. But if we were to get enough vitamin C, it’s possible that we would not only be a lot healthier overall but also be immune to the negative effects of smoking.  

Of particular note, `olive oil`, a staple of the Mediterranean diet, is a wonderful source of `vitamin C`. In fact, a compound in olive oil called `hydroxytyrosol` (HT) can increase your vitamin C levels by twofold! Add this to the long list of reasons I’m such a big fan of olive oil.  

Indeed good care of **gut buddies** and mitochondria by consuming plenty of mitochondrial uncouplers :  
* melatonin
* polyphenols
* fermented foods
* vitamin C and D  

Eat according to the `natural cycle` of the `seasons`.  

## To Everything There Is a Season
When we **constantly** feed ourselves, and hence our **gut buddies**, our mitochondria lose their metabolic flexibility, their ability to `generate ATP` using different types of fuel. As I often say, our `mitochondria` are meant to operate like `hybrid cars`, easily **switching** from **one fuel source to another**. In this case, you can think of `glucose` as the **hybrid car** gas and your `fat storage` as the **battery**. When `glucose` is available, `mitochondria` use it to **make energy** while **leaving the battery alone** to "charge". But when the gas **runs out** and there no `glucose` available, `mitochondria` can **keep running** on the `stored energy`. It’s another great system, if—and only if—you operate the car properly.  

We are meant to alternate between running on gas and battery power during each twenty-four-hour cycle. During the day, you run on gas. Then at night, you run on battery power. After all, you’re not eating in your sleep (at least, I hope not), so there’s no new glucose to burn. And you’re asleep, so you don’t need much energy. Your `mitochondria` can shift to a `slow burn` and do `repair` work using the `battery power` (in the form of free `fatty acids`) that was previously stored in your `fat cells`.  

This design not only helps you lose weight but also helps you live when glucose isn’t available, either because it’s nighttime or because you have to go for a long period without food. The latter was certainly the norm for our ancestors, who had to endure harsh conditions. This hybrid system kept them alive and thriving during lean times.  

`Mitochondria` can lose their metabolic flexibility, however, when we feed our **gut buddies** the **wrong foods**, particularly processed foods that offer our **gut buddies** no nourishment. These foods are the **opposite** of `resistant starch` and `fiber`, which `resist digestion` and make it to your **gut buddies** for them to eat instead of you. `Processed foods` are `hyperdigested`, leaving nothing for your **gut buddies** to `ferment`. Even worse, many of these foods contain `fructose`, which is absorbed in the gut and goes straight to the `liver`, where it is converted into `harmful` fatty acids such as `ceramides` and `palmitate` and released into your bloodstream. `Fructose` makes up half of the sugar in plain old table sugar (`sucrose`), which is hiding in nearly every packaged food, as well as in high-fructose corn syrup (hence the name), which has even more fructose than table sugar does. Fructose is also the main sugar in fruit.  

So now free `fatty acids` and `glucose` are rushing to your `mitochondria` all at once. This causes a `traffic jam` in your cells, and all that traffic creates ROSs that damage your `mitochondria`, which eventually lose their metabolic flexibility. This can lead to insulin resistance, obesity, and type` 2 diabetes`.  

The good news is that your `metabolic flexibility` can be restored when you start feeding your **gut buddies** not only the **right foods** but also **less** often.  

## CYCLING INTO AND OUT OF HIDING
At all times, your body monitors the amount of energy that is available and uses that information to decide whether to grow—because energy is plentiful—or to pull back and clean house—because times are tough and there isn’t much energy available. Your cells communicate this information with one another along a pathway called the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). You can think of `mTOR` as a **sensor for energy availability**. When mTOR senses that there is **energy to spare**, it **activates a growth hormone** called **insulin**-like `growth factor 1` (IGF-1), which leads `cells` to grow. But when mTOR senses that there isn’t a lot of energy available, it limits the production of IGF-1, which inhibits growth.  

By measuring your IGF-1 level, we can therefore assess how much `mTOR` is or isn’t being stimulated in your body. The problem is that when we overfeed ourselves and our **gut buddies**, mTOR is constantly stimulated. This can lead to `metabolic inflexibility`, sure, but it can also cause even bigger problems. For one thing, when IGF-1 tells cells to grow, it doesn’t discriminate between healthy cells, old and dysfunctional cells, and cancer cells. They all grow. This is why mTOR, which, again, stimulates IGF-1, contributes to cancer growth and makes cancer less responsive to treatment.  

When you give your body a break from producing IGF-1, cancerous cells are repaired or discarded, so they don’t have a chance to grow when more energy becomes available and IGF-1 increases again. The same thing happens with other damaged or faulty noncancerous cells that can age you and contribute to a variety of diseases. Bottom line: you don’t want mTOR being stimulated all the time. Suppressing mTOR and therefore IGF-1 `induces autophagy`, improves insulin resistance, increases longevity, and boosts metabolic health.  

We are meant to live in a seasonal cycle of growth and regression, stimulating mTOR and putting on weight while we are eating the plentiful food that grows in the spring and summer and then shedding that weight while eating less in the fall and winter. This is when we should be sending the signal to our cells (through low IGF-1) that there isn’t much energy available to grow and it’s time to focus on cleaning and repairs through autophagy. Simply put, the daily and yearly cycle should be: `IGF-1 goes up`, and cells grow and proliferate. Then `IGF-1 goes down`, and faulty cells are cleaned up or cleared out. When IGF-1 goes up again, there are only healthy cells left to grow. Repeat over and over throughout a long, healthy life.  

After all, there are seasons for a reason, and we adapted to eat according to those seasons. Mother Nature never intended for us to have fruit picked before it was ripe, shipped around the world, artificially ripened, and sold in grocery stores—not to mention bred for sweetness. Now we’re consuming these fructose bombs throughout the year. Instead, we are meant to be exposed to ripe, local fruit only during a specific time period each year, when we are in a `growth cycle`, putting on weight so that we can use the fat stores to make it through the winter season of regression. Of course, we have become disconnected from this yearly cycle. We are living in an endless summer, constantly sending growth signals to our cells. The result is metabolic inflexibility, weight gain, disease, rapid aging, and the growth of cancer cells, not to mention a dysbiotic microbiome that has adapted to eating that high-fructose-content, unnaturally ripened fruit year-round.  

To the contrary, we are meant to experience a cyclical reconfiguration of our `microbiome` based on what foods are available during `each season`. The Hadza people of Tanzania are some of the last hunter-gatherers on the planet. During the `wet season`, they forage for berries and eat more honey, whereas in the `dry season`, they focus on hunting, so they eat more meat. Throughout the year, they eat fibrous tubers, which are great for their **gut buddies**. An analysis of the Hadza people microbiomes across seasons reveals some very interesting things about how the microbiome is meant to adapt to seasonal change.  

Fascinatingly, the Hadza people microbiomes are virtually identical from one wet season to the next and from one dry season to the next. But there are dramatic changes between the dry and wet seasons. During the wet season, for example, the bacteria that ferment fructose grow and multiply. Then they take a back seat in the winter, when fruit is no longer available. This is another one of nature’s built-in mechanisms to keep any species from overgrowing, and it protects the Hadza people from metabolic inflexibility, which they do not experience despite eating lots of fruit and honey when it is plentiful.  

It’s also interesting to note that when you eat this way, many species of bacteria disappear completely during one season and then reappear the next. These are the **gut buddies** you read about earlier that live in **hiding down in the crypts**. They are always there, and they can be coaxed out of hiding when you provide them with their favorite foods. But when there’s nothing for them to eat, they go back into `hibernation`. This offers a ray of light for those suffering from `dysbiosis`, which unfortunately is most of us. How many of your **gut buddies** are in hiding right now? By feeding them the right foods at the right times, you can help them `reveal themselves` and get your ecosystem back into balance.  

As I mentioned, in addition to eating seasonally with periods of growth and regression, we are also meant to **eat only at certain times** throughout the day. The idea that we should be snacking or eating a bunch of **small meals all day long** is a complete and `total myth` that has done **incredible damage to our health**. As you read earlier, your mitochondria need a break at night to clean house and switch over to `battery power`. This is also when your `melatonin` level is high and can act on `mitochondria` as an antioxidant to clean up ROSs. When your `cells` are constantly being flooded with fuel, they never have a chance to take a break and complete the `cleanup process`.  

Following a `daily cycle` of growth and regression also allows the body to produce `ketones` to act as `mitochondrial uncouplers`. Normally, we start making ketones **eight hours** after we last ate. When we give our bodies enough time without food, those ketones help our `mitochondria repair` themselves and multiply.  

Furthermore, we often overlook the fact that digesting and carrying molecules across the gut wall is hard work that requires a huge amount of energy and blood flow. Your gut wall needs `downtime` to do its repair work and clean up dead or faulty cells, but this does not occur when it is always `taxed` with the job of digestion. The gut wall is **not great** at `multitasking`. Instead of having to digest and clean up at the same time, it’s much more efficient to concentrate the digestion workload over a shorter period of time and leave the rest of the day for cleaning. It’s another cycle,just like the one we should be following throughout the year.  

SUPPRESSING MTOR: THE HARD WAYS AND THE EASY WAYS
Besides following both daily and yearly cycles of growth and regression, there are additional ways to suppress mTOR to protect your health. One is by **restricting** your **intake** of `animal protein`. When `mTOR` is scanning the body for energy availability, it keeps an eye out for **certain amino acids** more than others. These are the amino acids that are the most necessary for growth : 
* methionine
* cysteine
* isoleucine  

which are found primarily in animal protein. These amino acids are deficient in most plant-based proteins. So if you avoid animal protein, you can eat as much as you want and still trick your body into thinking that you’re in a regression cycle, so it doesn’t trigger production of IGF-1 and stimulate mTOR.  

`Quercetin`, a type of flavonoid found in berries, onions, grapes, broccoli, and citrus fruits, strongly activates `sestrin` and `inhibits mTOR` in colon cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. The polyphenol resveratrol also activates sestrin genes and has been shown to protect against metabolic disease. You read earlier that resveratrol also activates SIRT1, which repairs and protects cellular DNA. Well, it turns out that SIRT1 also suppresses mTOR! `Polyphenols` regulate mTOR in two ways: through SIRT1 and sestrins. This makes perfect sense, since, as you know, your **gut buddies** are the ones that activate polyphenols and use them as signaling devices to your cells. In this case, your **gut buddies** use polyphenols to tell your cells to stop growing, to look out for and kill off faulty cells, to clean up healthy cells, and to repair and protect the cellular DNA. This is yet another way that they use their language to take care of you—if you have the righ tones.  

## MTOR, THE GUT, AND GENE EXPRESSION
There’s one more piece to this puzzle, and this one lies in our genes. Though we have more bacterial genes in our bodies than human genes, the human genes we do have are still pretty important. Yet our **gut buddies** play an enormous role in activating or silencing our human genes. All of our DNA lies in the nuclei of our cells, wrapped tightly around millions of proteins called histones. Histones basically help organize the overwhelming amount of data in our DNA so it can fit inside the tiny space of a cell’s nucleus. Anything that affects these histones therefore impacts your genetic expression. When histone levels change, for instance, certain genes can either be upregulated or repressed.  

`Histone deacetylases` (HDACs) allow cancer cells to grow and proliferate. HDAC inhibitors have been used in medicine as mood stabilizers, antiepileptics, anti-inflammatories, and antiparasitic drugs.  

They can also be used to treat cancer and induce tumor cell apoptosis. And guess what is one of the most powerful HDAC inhibitors in the world? `Butyrate`, the short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) produced by your **gut buddies**. Though other SCFAs also act as HDAC inhibitors, butyrate is the most effective at inhibiting HDAC activity, **stopping** cancer cells from proliferating, and stimulating specific gene expression.  

This brings me back to the beginning: if you have a robust, stable ecology of **gut buddies**, you don’t need to worry about HDACs, rapamycin, sestrins, or any of the other ways of suppressing mTOR—they will take care of that, and most other things, for you. But first, you have to help them help you by **feeding them the right foods at the right times**.  

## The Gut Check Eating Cycle
Trust me when I tell you that this method of eating is what your **gut buddies** want. And hopefully by now you are more than convinced to give them what they want! Time-restricted eating changes short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production in the microbiome, leading to an increase in `thermogenesis`. It also leads your body to `produce ketones`, which uncouple `mitochondria`, also increasing `thermogenesis` and `strengthening` the `gut wall`. In case you forgot, `thermogenesis` promotes weight loss, vitality, and good health. Plus, to reiterate, the process of digestion is a lot of work for your gut wall. It’s when you’re digesting that your **gut wall suffers the most stress**. Moreover, `lipopolysaccharides` (LPSs) hop onto fat molecule carrier `chylomicrons` (lipids) to **ride** into your body during the `digestion process`. This is when your gut wall and your immune system are most vulnerable to attack by `lectins` and other **disrupters**.  

You may be convinced that time-restricted eating is the way to go but still wary of the reality. I understand. This is why my program will help you slowly work your way up (or down, as the case may be) to the ideal `eating window`. Slowly compressing the period of time during which you eat will help your body become metabolically flexible, and you must be metabolically flexible in order to fully benefit from this (or quite frankly any) eating program.  

You’ll also **stop** eating at least **three hours before bedtime**. Doing so will give your body, your `mitochondria`, your **gut buddies**, and your brain the time they need to rest, repair, and regenerate themselves. Perhaps best of all, you need to maintain this compressed eating window only Monday through Friday. Over the weekend, you can be more flexible and eat according to whatever schedule works best for you.  

* **Week 1**: You’ll start breakfast at 8:00 a.m. and finish your last meal of the day by 7:00 p.m., Monday through Friday. Not bad, right? Once the weekend comes around, you can be more flexible—within reason! No midnight snacking, please. You can eat breakfast when you like, provided you’re still following the Gut Check program’s eating dos and don’ts and list of approved foods.
* **Week 2**: Week 2 is much like week 1 except that this week you will delay your first meal of the day by one hour, breaking your fast (break-fast, get it?) at 9:00 a.m.
* **Weeks 3 through 5**: Each successive week, you’ll follow the same basic schedule, but you’ll push breakfast back by another hour. This means that during week 3, breakfast will be at 10:00 a.m. Week 4? 11:00 a.m. And so on until you don’t have your first bite until noon, condensing your daily eating window to a mere seven hours (noon to 7:00 p.m.).  

> Note: I **default to 7:00 p.m.** as the end of the day **eating window**, as that seems to work best for most of my patients and gives them the **space** to have that **three-hour** break before bedtime. But the eating windows I’ve mentioned here are not absolute. You may have different needs due to work or family commitments. Go ahead and break your fast at 9:00 a.m. and stop eating at 4:00 p.m. if that works for you. The idea is to gradually ease yourway into a **six-to-eight-hour eating window**. It doesn’t really matter when that window opens and closes.  

Once you’ve made it through the first `five weeks`, enjoying the more flexible weekends  along  the  way,  you’ll  quickly  see  that  time-restricted eating can work with just about any lifestyle. And after you complete the initial  five-week  schedule,  you  may  notice  some  changes.  To  start,  you will  have  become  more  metabolically  flexible.  Even  better,  you’ll  have become accustomed to your condensed eating window, and it won’t seem like a hardship anymore.  

## GUT CHECK TIPS AND TRICKS
The `first two weeks` of this program can be a little challenging, **especially** if you’re used to eating breakfast first thing in the morning. Trust that when you stick with the program long enough to feel its many benefits, your metabolism will get the right messages from your `microbiome` and `mitochondria`, and those hunger pangs will diminish. But if you’re finding it hard to manage your hunger, here are a few tips.  

First, make sure that you stay well hydrated. When you’re getting enough to drink, you feel less hungry.  

When choosing a beverage, adding `polyphenols` is a bonus. You should feel free to indulge your morning caffeine habit with either green or **black tea** or **black coffee**. All of these beverages are rich in `polyphenols` for your **gut buddies** (and, contrary to popular belief, they don’t dehydrate you). Remember, `caffeine` also works as a `mitochondrial uncoupler` in its own right. If you don’t like caffeine, try decaf or have an herbal tea made with herbs containing `polyphenols` such as **mint**. And if you aren’t ready to give up your creamer just yet, choose one of the many keto MCT creamers on the market.  

To give your water a little flavor and add in the power of `fermented polyphenols`, try adding a dash of `balsamic` or `apple cider vinegar` to make a refreshing sparkler. In addition to all of its other benefits, such as training the immune system, consuming fermented foods (or beverages) increases your levels of conjugated linoleic acid (`CLA`), a positive health- promoting molecule.  

Another trick is to consume `MCT oil`. Try eating a **spoonful** of MCT oil (preferably the `C8 or C10` varieties, which are more `ketogenic`) **three times** a day. You can start with a teaspoon to help you get through those sinking spells and eventually move up to a tablespoon. A note of caution, however: some people experience some gastrointestinal distress after ingesting MCT oil. This is common in many of my female patients. I recommend using it sparingly at first and working your way up to larger amounts. Some people do much better with MCT powders, several of which are available as coffee creamers. The beauty of MCT oil is that it will not break your fast, and of course it generates ketones.  

One of the best ways to keep hunger pangs at bay is to **increase** the amount of **prebiotic fiber** or fermented foods that you ingest. Again, it’s all about keeping your **gut buddies** happy and satisfied. You can add prebiotic fiber to your meals, but I find that the best way is to just mix a scoop of prebiotic fiber powder such as `psyllium` (mucilaginous) or `ground flaxseed` (mucilaginous) into some water, add a tablespoon of apple cider or other vinegar, and drink it. If this is not appealing, sweeten it with allulose, a rare true noncaloric sweetener that feeds friendly **gut buddies**. Because you can’t digest any of these things, **they won’t break your fast**, but they will make for the best breakfast your **gut buddies** could ever ask for. They’ll start producing `butyrate` and send messages **telling** your `brain` that they are full and content and no more food is required. Amazing!  

Yet another trick is to enjoy an `MCT capraccino`. No, that’s not a typo for “cappuccino”! I use it to refer to the Latin word capra for the genus of goat. This tasty beverage, made of coffee and goat milk, will increase uncoupling and is especially helpful if you experience gastrointestinal issues from MCT. This is an extremely tasty and beneficial way to start the day without having to extend your fasting hours.  

I buy roasted barukas (baru) nuts and sacha inchi seeds, which have a high polyphenol content, and then grind iodized sea salt onto them.  

In general, it’s beneficial to **increase** your `salt intake` as you work to shorten your eating window. I’ll say it again: salt is not your enemy! `Ketones` actually compete with uric acid, the mischief maker that causes gout, to be excreted from the kidneys. But you can solve this problem by increasing your salt consumption by about a teaspoon a day. Just make sure it’s iodized sea salt, as the `pink stuff` and other varieties of sea salt do not contain iodine.  

I’m also fond of `electrolyte` replacement powders such as those made by the brand LMNT. We even have our own version at Gundry MD. That said, I recommend avoiding most popular electrolyte drinks, even the sugar-free ones, as they tend to be loaded with toxic artificial sweeteners that kill your **gut buddies**. Not worth it!  

When you are hungry, you can also eat a nut or `coconut bar`. In exciting research published in 2021, my friend and colleague Dr. Valter Longo at the University of Southern California reported that eating a 200- calorie, mostly nut-based bar called a Fast Bar did not interrupt ketone production or raise blood sugar in people who were following a time- restricted eating plan. You heard that right: eating this bar did not interrupt their ketone production from an overnight fast! This is good news. It means that eating a handful of nuts or a nut-based bar will not sabotage your ketone-generating efforts. It will probably keep the hunger demon at bay, too.  

Another option to help you deal with your hunger is to take a few capsules or a scoop of preformed ketones in the form of `ketone salts` or esters. Believe it or not, these supplements are the real deal. They quickly tell your `mitochondria` that it’s time to start uncoupling. Even better, ingested ketones have the same beneficial effects on the gut `microbiome` as the traditional ketogenic diet. Though ketone salts are relatively easy to find, the esters, quite frankly, are very expensive and taste pretty terrible. It’s easier and more palatable for most of my patients to stick with `MCT oils` or goat and sheep milk products **instead**.  

Their inner voice tells them that there’s no way they’ll make it to `week 5`.  

If this happens to you, stick with the `week 1` eating schedule for another week, and then, instead of shortening the eating window by an hour each week, shorten it by half an hour. It may take you more than five weeks to get to the ideal eating window this way, but you’ll get there! You will become comfortable with being uncomfortable, I promise. Then the reverse effect will kick in: you will become comfortable eating this way and uncomfortable not eating this way. It never fails to shock my patients when they come to prefer this way of eating. But it’s not surprising, is it? Your **gut buddies** are in command, and you get to enjoy the ride!  

Finally, on some days, you may be struggling and psychologically need to feel fueled and alert. Maybe you have a big presentation or an extra hard workout. In these cases, have your breakfast a bit early, or grab one of those nut bars (or some `nuts`) on your way out the door. The next day, you can get right back on track. Anytime you make changes to your diet and lifestyle, it is common to experience challenges and setbacks. Go easy on yourself, and do your best to stay the course.  

## ALLOW SOME FLEXIBILITY
Though I’ve provided you with a basic schedule, one of the biggest benefits of this form of time-restricted eating is that it offers some flexibility. Provided that you strive for a shortened eating window, you can schedule your meals as best fits your lifestyle. For example, I have patients who are attached to having breakfast at a certain time in the morning. They feel that they need to start the day with something in their belly or they won’t be able to function for the rest of the day. If this is you, you have two options: you can grab a nut bar, or you can go for what I like to call the Ramadan option.  

Try eating breakfast, skipping lunch, and then waiting to eat dinner as your last meal of the day. Even better, grab a handful of nuts, a piece of goat or sheep milk cheese, or an approved bar for your breakfast.  

It’s likely that in time, as your metabolism adjusts and becomes more flexible, you’ll find that you’re more than ready to start pushing out breakfast to a later hour.  

Another option that some of my patients appreciate is the one-meal-a-day (OMAD) plan. If you’re already engaging in some form of intermittent fasting or you find the first five weeks of the schedule fairly easy, you can turbocharge your progress by eating a single meal each day. This is exactly how I conduct my own time-restricted eating for a large part of each year. From **January to June**, I eat a `single meal` between 6:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. That’s right: I **fast for twenty-two hours** a day, five days a week, six months of the year.  

Though this option may seem extreme (and many of you may doubt that it is even possible!), I can assure you that it is not only possible but, with time, is easier to sustain than you might imagine. And the **results** are `undeniable`! When my patients try the OMAD approach, I can `immediately` see the **difference in their blood work**. By significantly reducing the time your gut spends digesting food, you can give your mitochondria the rest they need to uncouple and thrive.  

I usually drop ten to fifteen pounds every year during this time period —and then, over the next six months, I gain it back. Huh? How stupid is that? Not stupid at all. Think back to our ancestors and their yearly cycle. Our hunter-gatherer forebears had to cope with a limited food supply during the winter and spring. Summer and fall, of course, brought bountiful options. By taking this more seasonal approach, which is deeply engrained in our genes and our **gut buddies**’ genes, your **gut buddies** and mitochondria will benefit. This is the circadian seasonal rhythm that’s been flowing through you and your **gut buddies** for millions of years. Why mess with success?  

If you’d like to give this plan a try, I suggest starting after the five- week marker, when you’re eating your first meal at noon and **stopping all food intake by 7:00 p.m.** During week 6, you can push your first meal to 1:00 p.m.; week 7, to 2:00 p.m. And so on until you **reach the two-hour OMAD window by week 11**.  

If you are considering going OMAD, I must also offer a word of caution. Over and over again, I and others have shown that it is not healthy to consistently stay in a state of **ketosis**. Humans have never thrived by starving themselves over the long term. Our bodies are designed to benefit from periods of both `feast` and `famine`. But famine on its own? That’s a nonstarter.  

So if you go OMAD, again, lighten up on the weekend and have two meals a day, maybe even three. I mention the Ramadan and OMAD options to, once again, illustrate that there are many ways to successfully embrace time-restricted eating. Provided that you aim for a condensed eating window, you can find a schedule that works for you and your **gut buddies**.  

Okay! Now that you know when you’re going to eat, let’s take a closer look at what you’re going to eat.  

## FOOD SENSITIVITIES AND LEAKY GUT
Thanks to work by Dr. Alessio Fasano, who is now at Harvard, and many others, the science of `leaky gut`, or intestinal permeability, is now proven and well established. Not only that, but more and more of the mechanisms, many of which you are now familiar with, are constantly coming to light. And thanks to the National Institute of Health Human Microbiome Project, which started in 2007 and was completed in 2016, scientists only recently discovered the heretofore unexplored inner "galaxy" of your `gut population`. Moreover, with each passing year, better tests are being developed to measure and quantify leaky gut and to determine the population of microbes living within an individual gut. These advances have allowed me (and many others in our field) access to the information I needed to figure out why 90 percent of people restore their health with my program and the remaining 10 percent lag behind. In my clinics we use [Vibrant Wellness](https://www.vibrant-wellness.com/)) to test blood and urine for leaky gut, food sensitivities, environmental toxins, mycotoxins, heavy metals, and other things.  

Early on, a panel of tests was developed to check for `celiac disease` (the extreme form of `gluten intolerance`); intestinal permeability using anti-zonulin IgG and IgA, anti-actin IgG and IgA, and anti-LPS IgG and IgA; and antibodies to wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), antibodies to the multiple proteins that constitute gluten, such as gliadins and glutenins, and antibodies to nongluten proteins. (About 25 percent of the proteins in wheat are not gluten.) All these tests together were called the "Wheat Zoomer". (It was named “Zoomer” before the advent of Zoom calls.) Subsequently, Zoomers were done for antibodies to the multiple proteins in corn, called the Corn Zoomer; multiple antibodies to lectin- containing foods, called the Lectin Zoomer; several antibodies to the various proteins in dairy, including whey, A1 casein, and A2 casein, called the Dairy Zoomer; and antibodies to the proteins in both egg whites and egg yolks, called the Egg Zoomer. Finally, tests were developed to look at IgG and IgA antibodies to two hundred of the most common foods that people eat to determine their food sensitivities.  

To be clear, `food sensitivities` are not the same as `food allergies`. `Allergies` are driven by a different `immunoglobulin` called IgE. We used to do food allergy tests with a hundred or so pinpricks on people’s backs, and frankly, I never thought they were much help. But `food sensitivities` are different. Let me explain. Ordinarily, the food you eat is digested by your `digestive enzymes` and your `gut microbiome` into individual molecules of protein (amino acids), sugar molecules such as glucose or fructose from carbohydrates, and fatty acids.  

With the exceptions of fats, these molecules are passed through each cell lining your gut and channeled into the large portal vein heading into your liver. If there are gaps in the lining of your gut wall, meaning that you have leaky gut, potentially `undigested pieces` of food can pass through the wall and be seen as "foreign" by the immune system lining your gut. These guys will say, for example, "What’s that piece of broccoli doing in here? I’ve never seen broccoli before. It’s foreign, and I will make an antibody against it, and if I ever see it again, I’ll attack it and call in the troops for inflammation." These antibodies are IgG and IgA, not IgE. What did I learn after doing thousands of tests on my patients over the last ten years, and what does all this mean to you?  

Let’s start with the Wheat Zoomer, which also is our test for `leaky gut`. One hundred percent of all patients with `autoimmune diseases` and markers for autoimmune diseases have markers for `leaky gut`. Period. All patients with `IBS` have markers for leaky gut. Period. When tested, all patients with `coronary artery` disease have leaky gut. Period. Same for diabetes. Need I go on?  

What about `wheat`? Remarkably, when we start working together, 98 percent of tested patients have strong IgG antibodies to wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), gluten, and nongluten components of wheat. Even patients who are "gluten free" and haven’t eaten gluten in ten years test positive! How is that possible? Let me explain. When you were a kid, you got a tetanus shot. Your body made IgG antibodies to the tetanus bacteria so that if you ever stepped on a rusty nail, your immune system would recognize the tetanus bacteria, call in the troops, and kill it. Every ten years or so, you need to get a booster shot because your immunity gradually declines. It needs to be reexposed to the troublemaker so that you will make more antibodies against it. What the Wheat Zoomer revealed is that nearly all of us have strong antibodies against the various components of wheat. Remember, WGA is such a small lectin that it can cross through the gut wall even without leaky gut, unlike gluten, which actually causes leaky gut. Also remember that WGA occurs only in whole grains. And whole grains have only relatively recently been introduced to our diets. As you know, WGA binds to the glycocalyx on our blood vessels, our blood-brain barrier, our joint surfaces, even the surface of our eyeballs. All of us have antibodies against it, so our body attacks it, along with whatever it’s stuck to. Hold that thought; it gets worse.  

Why do we have antibodies to wheat, even if we don’t currently eat it? That’s because with leaky gut, lectins, bacteria, and undigested food are all crossing the gut wall into your body 24/7. The immune system believes that you are **under constant attack** and keeps all antibodies against foreign substances active, primed, and ready. I see this with every new patient. Literally everyone who shows up to my office, for whatever disease or issue, has antibodies to the various components of wheat, rye, barley, and oats.  

That’s pretty dire sounding, isn’t it? But let’s pause a moment for some good news. When my patients seal their leaky gut, all the antibodies to WGA, gluten, and wheat disappear. They’re gone. Unmeasurable. The immune system stands down; the **gut buddies** "teach" the immune system that all is well, they’ve got your back, and it’s time to take their finger off the trigger. Remarkable? Yes. Predictable? Well, `Hippocrates` knew it twenty-five hundred years ago; I’m just a slow learner. What about `corn`? Seventy percent of my patients with leaky gut react to the proteins in corn. Many react to corn as if it were gluten. Moreover, most corn grown in the United States is `GMO` and carries a new protein called `cry`. The name is appropriate. Since it is new, most of us develop an antibody to it.  

## POPEYE WAS WRONG
Now for `lectins`. As you know, lectins are part of a plant’s defense system against being eaten. In The Plant Paradox and my subsequent books, the lectin-containing foods list to avoid is extensive, but it is not complete. We now also test for another class of lectins called `aquaporins` (AQPs). Plants have `pores` in their leaves that they "breathe" through. Through these pores, water vapor moves in and out, carbon dioxide moves in, and oxygen moves out. These pores are controlled by `aquaporins` (water pores, get it?).  

We also have `aquaporins` that are nearly identical to plant `aquaporins` in the **wall of our gut**, our **blood-brain barrier**, and the **lining around our nerves**, called the `myelin sheath`. Through molecular mimicry, **if you develop antibodies** to certain plant aquaporins, your immune system can attack your own aquaporins, leading to leaky gut, leaky brain, and leaky nerve sheaths, the last resulting in multiple sclerosis (MS). Aquaporins are present in most nightshades, including tobacco, bell peppers, tomatoes, potatoes, and soybeans, plus corn, and—drumroll, please—spinach! Sadly, many of my patients with `MS`, irritable bladder syndrome, and/or brain fog have **antibodies** to the `spinach` aquaporin—and they happen to be big spinach eaters. My advice to you readers who have an autoimmune condition is to ditch these aquaporin-containing foods, and that means spinach, as well. Sorry.  

Speaking of sorry, a great number of those ten percenters who do everything I’ve previously recommended and still don’t resolve completely test positive for antibodies to all forms of dairy products, including those made with A2 casein, goat milk, and sheep milk, and both egg yolks and egg whites. Again, fear not. When the `leaky gut` is resolved, most people can reintroduce these foods slowly. In fact, studies suggest that fermentation makes casein much less antigenic, another reason to favor fermented milk products.  

## WHERE’S THE MEAT?
In my previous books, I noted that all animals have a `sugar molecule` (sialic acid, for you purists) that `coats` their `glycocalyx`.  
* beef
* lamb
* pork
* bison  

have the molecule `Neu5Gc`, whereas :
* humans
* fish
* chicken
* other fowl  

have a similar but not identical one called `Neu5Ac`. They differ by only one molecule of oxygen, but `Neu5Gc` is **foreign** to our immunesystem. When we eat `Neu5Gc`-containing foods, we make **antibodies** to `Neu5Gc`, and the more Neu5Gc-containing foods we eat, the **more antibodies** to it we make.  

If you’ve been paying attention, you can probably guess where this is going. Numerous studies have long associated `red meat` eating with increased risk of developing 
* heart disease
* arthritis
* even cancer  

We assumed that when our immune system reacts over and over to `Neu5Gc` (a foreign molecule), it becomes **hyperalert** and starts `reacting` to the `Neu5Ac` lining our blood vessels, `our` blood-brain barrier, and even `our` joints, because it’s so similar. It appeared that it was another case of molecular mimicry.  

Could this be why diets high in `red meat` are associated with higher rates of `coronary artery` disease and cancer? Remember, **association** does not equal *causation*. Interestingly, cancer cells use `Neu5Gc` to **cloak** themselves from the `immune system`. `Neu5Gc` is found in tumors. We do **not manufacture** it in our bodies! So it has to be **acquired** from our *diet*. This may explain the association between `red meat` consumption and cancer.  

And that was where the debate stood. Until now. The `glycocalyx` is where your bloodstream and your `white blood cells` interact with the surface of your blood vessels, your blood-brain barrier, and your joint surfaces. It’s *composed* of lots of `Neu5Ac` sialic acid molecules, which are **constantly** damaged and replenished.  

Here’s the **bad news**: `Neu5Gc` is `rapidly absorbed` in your `small intestine` when you eat Neu5Gc-containing foods and can be easily `incorporated` into your `glycocalyx`. The more foods with `Neu5Gc` you eat, the more it **replaces** the `Neu5Ac` that is **supposed** to be there. And the **more** of these foods you eat, the more `antibodies` against it you make and—you guessed it—**the more** you attack the very structure that is supposed to protect your blood vessels, your brain, and your joints.  

Want more scary news before I give you an out? The `brain` abhors `Neu5Gc`. Even animals that make `Neu5Gc` won’t let it into their brain. They **actively** keep it out. Yet when `Neu5Gc` is incorporated into your `blood-brain barrier`, it is **attacked**. The now-damaged BBB lets `Neu5Gc` into the brain, setting the **stage** for `neuroinflammation`. Worse, there is **strong evidence** that Neu5Gc breaking the blood-brain barrier allows the ``Epstein-Barr`` virus (EBV) access to the brain during `mononucleosis infections`. `Anti-Neu5Gc` antibody levels are very high in patients with `multiple sclerosis` (MS), suggesting that `Neu5Gc` is what makes the association of `EBV` and `MS` (and, for that matter, `chronic fatigue syndrome`, or CFS) so intriguing. And guess what? `Neu5Gc` is a `major gut wall disrupter`, as well. So, dear reader, it is no longer a case of association does not equal causation. We now know the cause of the **association** between `red meat` and all of the above. Does this mean you **can’t** eat grass-fed, grass-finished beef? Pastured lamb or pork? Bison, deer, elk? `That’s my general advice`. Trust me, that makes this boy from Omaha `very sad`. But there are several **work-arounds**.  

First, yes, the `more Neu5Gc`-containing foods you eat, the `more antibodies` you will make `against Neu5Gc` and the more it will be **incorporated** into your vessels, your joints, and your brain. But if you eat a **lot less** of those foods (meat) and a `lot more Neu5Ac`-containing foods, such as poultry, fish, and shellfish, the **more you will replace Neu5Gc with Neu5Ac**. So can you have your steak and eat it, too? Yes, but be conscious of the fact that `every time you eat Neu5Gc`-containing foods, `you restart the damage` that then has to be undone.  

Organ meats, particularly `liver`, contain the `highest levels of Neu5Gc`. `Bone broth`? Forget about it! Gut healing? `How about gut damaging`? But good news, `chicken liver` and `chicken broth both` contain `Neu5Ac`. No wonder those long-lived Italians eat `chicken liver pate` and your Jewish grandmother prescribed `chicken soup` for every ailment!  

The second piece of good news is that a recent study showed that your **gut buddies** and bacteria in general can eat `Neu5Gc` either in the colon or in **foods** before it is consumed (`during fermentation`), so that you `will not absorb` it and it will not do any **damage**. How can this be if `Neu5Gc` is absorbed from the small intestine long before it gets to where the **gut buddies** can work their magic? The answer has been staring us in the face in the long-lived societies whose people eat these foods. Remember, because `meat` is such a **limited resource**, these meat eaters grind up the animal from nose to tail, mix in spices and salt, and allow it to cure, aka **ferment**. The bacteria eat the sugar molecule `Neu5Gc`, destroying it. So the `answer` seems to be eating `old-fashioned fermented meats` such as cured sausages, chorizo, and salami.  

But wait, there’s more `mischief` afoot (or should I say abreast?). The `milk` from these animals is also loaded with `Neu5Gc`. Refrigeration is a relatively new invention, yet the practice of milking animals goes back thousands of years. Enter `fermentation` again. Yogurt, kefir, hard, aged cheeses such as parmesan and pecorino, and cheeses made with raw, `unpasteurized milk` have significantly `reduced Neu5Gc` levels. This may explain the paradox in that **Swedish study** I mentioned earlier showing that drinking milk **worsened** angina but eating cheese **lessened** it. The `milk` had the antigenic `Neu5Gc`, and the `cheese did not`. It all starts to add up, doesn’t it?  

On this plan, I am recommending for the first time that you eat some `chicken gristle`, some `pastured chicken skin`, and some `sardines` and other `small fish` such as `anchovies` and `herring`, bones and all. In addition to their feeding your **gut buddies**, we don’t make enough of many important amino acids such as `glutamate` and `glycine`, and the `collagen` in these contains an amino acid called `trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline` that we cannot make ourselves and that **scavenges** for ROSs and is **catabolized** into `glycine` in the body! It is a good idea for vegetarians and vegans to supplement with `vegan collagen`. Another form of protein, `gelatin`, can **protect** the `gut lining`, particularly when paired with `tannic acid`, which is a type of `polyphenol`.  

Small wild fish and shellfish are also **good forms** of `animal protein`. The smaller the fish, the better. Sardines, herring, and anchovies, as well as wild salmon and bivalves (clams, oysters, mussels, and the like) are all great sources of `omega-3 fatty acids` and `phospholipids` that don’t contain much mercury and other heavy metals. Just be sure to avoid "organic" farm-raised salmon, which are **fed** corn and soybean meal. Thanks to **changes** in their diet, farmed salmon `no longer make DHA` and instead **produce inflammatory** `omega-6 fatty acids`.  

`Omega-3 eggs` are another good option for many people, but a number of my autoimmune patients do **react** to the proteins in both the whites and the yolks. When it comes to `meat`, you can enjoy **smaller amounts** (a maximum of **114gr**) of the highest-quality poultry and fish you can get. Factory-farmed meats and seafoods, including farmed salmon and shrimp, are `fed antibiotics` to prevent disease and **fatten** them up. The antibiotics make their way into the `animals flesh`, and when you consume it, they **kill off** your **gut buddies**. Focus on `organic products`, wild seafood, and pasture-raised chicken.  

Finally, before you jump on the "Dr. Gundry says I should eat chicken" bandwagon, not so fast. I grew up in Nebraska. `Chickens` there were farm animals. They went out in the cow pastures every day and scratched through the cow pies, **eating the bugs and spreading the manure**. Then they’d come back to the henhouse and lay eggs. When an old hen couldn’t lay eggs anymore, she became a stewing hen. Her flesh was so gristly and tough that she had to be cooked all day and sometimes all night, breaking down all the collagen that we, and hence our **gut buddies**, ate. And her meat was loaded with the proper ratio of `omega-6 to omega-3` fats, about `3–5` to 1, respectively. Recent analysis of commercial grocery **store chicken** shows that the ratio is now `25 to 1`. This means that the once `anti-inflammatory chicken` is now an `omega-6 inflammatory bomb`. When you do find a good pasture- raised chicken such as the ones you can buy at Lectin-Light Chicken (https://lectinlightchicken.com/), buy the **whole bird** and use the **whole thing**, not the boneless, skinless breast that’s devoid of all the good stuff such as the `spermidine` in the skin and the `collagen` in the tendons. As for dairy products, you already know that `cow milk products` in the United States come from a breed of cow that produces milk with a `highly inflammatory protein` called `A1 beta-casein`. That’s why I **recommend** you choose` goat or sheep milk` dairy products or cow milk dairy from southern European (A2 beta-casein) cows. Goat, sheep, and water buffalo cheeses and **yogurts** are far `superior choices`, as they are powerful `mitochondrial uncouplers`, plus the `Neu5Gc` is eaten in the **fermentation process**. Lastly, organic **heavy cream** has no `Neu5Gc`, so go ahead and get your milk fat globule membranes (`MFGMs`) from that.  

One final note of caution for readers who have been **diagnosed** with an **autoimmune disorder**: the 10 percent of patients who don’t fully recover on my program usually test positive for reacting to all forms of dairy products, including `A2 beta-casein`, as well as **both egg whites and egg yolks**. So if you are reading this book for help, for now, **give up all dairy and all eggs**. And don’t worry, most of you can **reintroduce them later** as your `gut wall` heals, your immune system quiets, and your `microbiome` replenishes and fortifies.  

## THE TOP OFFENDERS
Let’s look at the other most common culprits that show up as sensitive foods in my patients blood work. Apologies in advance; you may not like some of this. The top twelve offenders, besides the worst lectin offenders already mentioned, are: 
* Almonds and almond flour
* White mushrooms
* Ginger
* Pineapple
* Peaches
* White onions
* Lemons
* Bananas
* Nutmeg
* Cinnamon
* Commercial poultry
* Vanilla bean   

Now, this list doesn’t mean that you personally are sensitive to all or any of these foods, but **consider** them as additional foods to think about **removing** from your diet. There are, of course, substitutions. Use **brown** or other forms of **mushrooms**; use **red or yellow onions** instead of white; use **nectarines** or **plums** instead of peaches; use *limes* instead of lemons; use coconut, chestnut, or tiger nut flour instead of **almond flour**. To wrap this up, thousands of patient tests later, I can now give you a much clearer and educated program for "good" foods and "bad" foods. There is **no need to argue** or debate about the dangers or benefits of wheat, rye, barley, and oats, when nearly most people have **antibodies against WGA**, and gluten. And consuming `Neu5Gc` in beef, lamb, pork, bison, venison, and other meats will produce antibodies to it and it will be **incorporated** into the `glycocalyx` on your blood vessels, blood-brain barrier, and joints, and further worsen `leaky gut`. This discussion doesn’t even touch on the fact that c**ancerous tumors incorporate dietary Neu5Gc** into their cell walls to avoid detection. Oh, my! Another way to say this is that your **grass-fed burger** on your **organic whole wheat** bun with an **organic milk** shake may be the perfect storm that will `ruin` your short- and long-term health. On the other hand, eating some **traditionally** prepared fermented `sausages` with `goat or sheep milk yogurt` and some `raw cheese` for "break-fast" at noon topped off with `polyphenols`.

## The Gut Check Food Plan
The biggest change is that **overall**, you are going to be eating `not for yourself but for your gut buddies`. When you give them the foods they need to thrive, **you** will `thrive right alongside them`. Rest assured that your `gut buddies` enjoy a wide variety of foods. The foods that are best for your gut buddies—and therefore for you— can be broken down into three main categories:  
* prebiotics
* probiotics
* postbiotics  

it’s actually quite simple if you break it down this way:  
* prebiotics are food for your gut buddies, such as polyphenols and prebiotic fiber.
* probiotics are the gut buddies themselves, which are found in yogurt and fermented foods.
* postbiotics are the beneficial products that your gut buddies and bacteria and yeasts outside and inside your gut produce, such as the acetate found in vinegar.  

`Postbiotics` are part of the **all-important messaging system** that your **gut buddies** use to communicate with your `mitochondria` and the rest of your body. And of course, you need all three of these to reach a state of `homeostasis`. You need the **gut buddies** themselves to do the work for you. They need `nourishment` to grow, thrive, and do their various jobs. And the `postbiotics` are the all-important end products that you need to modulate so many of your `body functions`.  

What exactly do your gut buddies want to eat? Primarily, they need `polyphenols` and `vegetables` that contain `prebiotic fiber`, along with more `polyphenols`. And they need `fermented foods` that contain valuable information. If those fermented foods contain polyphenols, even better. Don’t forget that :  
* coffee
* dark chocolate
* red wine
* champagne  

all contain `polyphenols`! Yes, you can **indulge** in these favorites and more.  

You can also enjoy **nuts** and **some seeds**, **sheep and goat milk** dairy products that contain `probiotics` and `postbiotics`, `pressure-cooked` lentils and other legumes, some wild fish, shellfish, and mollusks, and, if you desire, pastured poultry, omega-3 eggs, and, on occasion, `fermented meat` products such as traditionally cured and `fermented sausages`. In season,your **gut buddies** also enjoy `low-fructose` fruits. As you can see, there is plenty of variety here, as well as flexibility. You can follow this program whether you are vegan, paleo, or anything in between.  

## WHAT WE ARE GOING TO ACCOMPLISH THROUGH THIS PROGRAM
Program is made of foods that will **nourish your gut** by feeding your **friendliest** and most productive** gut buddies**. This helps them make those important `postbiotics` and encourages them to **send** signals to the rest of your body **saying that everything is A-okay** down in the gut. These foods will also encourage the `gut buddies` that have gone into hiding to come out and start working for you, too. It’s just as important to **eliminate the foods** that kill off your gut buddies and/or allow the gang members lurking in your gut to **overgrow**. By feeding the good guys instead of the bad guys, you will reach the **elusive state** of `homeostasis`. The result will be the type of robust, `thriving microbiome` that is your birthright.  

## Fortify the Gut Wall
By eliminating foods that damage the gut wall and adding others—particularly uncouplers that will keep the mitochondria in your gut wall strong and healthy—you will **build up your defenses** against invaders. The below program will `heal your gut wall`, dramatically `reduce inflammation` throughout your body, and help **restore** your inner ecosystem. Fortifying your gut wall can do amazing things, including reversing severe disease. No matter what state your gut is in now, `it can be healed`!  

## Protect the Glycocalyx
To **avoid** and even reverse symptoms of **autoimmunity**, you will make sure that your immune system has no reason to attack any of your protective sugar linings, including the blood-brain barrier safeguarding your brain! These linings are the **second line** of defense that you wouldn’t need to worry about if the gut wall hadn’t been breached. By healing and protecting them simultaneously, you will see a huge drop in **inflammation** and **autoimmunity**.  

## Uncouple Mitochondria
As you work to restore your microbiome, your **gut buddies** will be able to send messages through short-chain fatty acids (`SCFAs`), activated `polyphenols`, and other compounds telling your **mitochondria to uncouple**, make more of themselves, and "waste" fuel. This will help **fortify** the `gut wall`, protect you from all sorts of diseases, and boost the health of the cells and tissues throughout your body. As another nice effect, by doing a `caloric bypass`, it will also help you lose weight!  

## DOS AND DON’TS
You’ll aim to avoid `gut-busting lectins` at **all costs**, especially that `sneaky little lectin` wheat germ agglutinin (`WGA`). You’ll add foods to your diet that are especially good for your **gut buddies**, including plenty of `fermented foods` and `fermented polyphenols` that will kick-start their communication process. To guide your choices and help you incorporate these foods into your meals, I’ve created a simple list of dos and don’ts.  

## Do: Eat Polyphenol-Rich Foods
As you know, your **gut buddies** absolutely `adore polyphenols` and activate them so that they can act as `mitochondrial uncouplers`. This helps both your inner ecosystem and the cells throughout your body thrive. We are seeing more and more evidence that `eating polyphenols` helps protect against `intestinal permeability`. But of course! When the `mitochondria` in your gut wall uncouple and make more of themselves, the health and stability of that wall are **protected**. Whether you prefer coffee to tea, kiwis to red berries, or endive to kale, the plant kingdom is full of delicious `polyphenol-rich` options to suit any palate while satisfying and nourishing your gut buddies. However, it’s important also to consider the sugar and grain levels of these foods before consuming them. Here’s a list of common foods sorted by their `polyphenol content`, ranked from **highest to lowest**.

## Do: Eat Fermented Foods
As you recall, your **gut buddies** need predigested or prefermented foods that contain intermediary `SCFAs` before they can do their job of producing those `all-important SCFAs` for you. This is the **only way for you to benefit** from the `dietary fiber` that you’re going to eat on the program.  

However, it’s important to be careful when choosing which `fermented` foods to eat. Conventional yogurt is a nonstarter, as it contains tons of sugar along with inflammatory A1 cow milk. Yes, that includes Greek yogurt. Plain `sheep and goat milk yogurts` are much better choices, as are  
* low-sugar kombucha
* raw cheeses, cheese from Italy, France, and Switzerland
* apple cider, and any other vinegars, sauerkraut, and kimchi.  

## Do: Ferment Your Polyphenols
`Polyphenols and fermented` foods are both essential for your gut, so what happens when you eat `fermented polyphenols`? Your gut benefits doubly, and so do you. This is because you are consuming those `polyphenols` already in their active state and your body can put them **to use immediately**.  

Many foods that are high in `polyphenols` can be fermented, including teas, vegetables, and fruits. **Red wine** and **champagne** are sources of `fermented polyphenols`, as is `balsamic vinegar`, one of my favorites. It’s easier than you may think to incorporate more `balsamic vinegar` into your diet: you can simply take a shot every morning, add it to your green smoothie, pour it on top of goat or sheep milk yogurt or ice cream, or add it to your salad dressing. (It’s much healthier and very easy to make salad dressing at home instead of buying it.) As I shared earlier, one of my favorite tricks is to add a shot of **vinegar** to sparkling water. I started suggesting adding **balsamic vinegar** to sparkling water years ago, and this **healthy soda** has now become a trend. I’m glad to see that more people are giving their gut buddies this treat!  

One word of caution: many companies are catching on to the power of `fermented polyphenols` and are selling beverages made of `fermented juice`.Make sure to take a good look at their **sugar content** before consuming them!  

## Do: Get Your Vitamin D
I put almost all of my patients on a pharmacological dose of `vitamin D` to **calm** their **immune system** and recruit the stem cells hiding in the crypts of the `microvilli` of the gut wall. I have seen time and time again that this repairs the gut wall and **reduces** inflammation and autoimmunity. Studies are beginning to be published reporting the same thing. In 2022, a study showed that `vitamin D` helped **reduce** autoimmunity. Well, of course it did. When your gut wall is intact and your immune system is **not on hyperalert**, there is no reason for it to attack your body. And in 2023, another study showed that more `vitamin D` equaled less dementia. Again, this makes perfect sense to me—and hopefully to you now, too.  

How much `vitamin D` should you **take**? One of the leading `vitamin D` research groups at the University of California San Diego believes that the average person should take `9,600 IU` of vitamin D3 per day **to have safe and therapeutic levels**. They have not seen, nor have I, vitamin D **toxicity** when supplementing with **up to 40,000 IU daily**. Indeed, many of my autoimmune and `leaky gut` patients initially require doses of **20,000 IU daily**. I aim for levels of 100 to 150 ng/ml on blood tests.  

## Do: Eat Postbiotic-Producing Foods  
When you eat foods that help your buddies create signaling molecules, you’re helping them communicate effectively with your immune system and your `mitochondria`. **Cruciferous vegetables** such as  
* broccoli
* cauliflower
* **sulfur-containing** veggies
    * onions
    * garlic
    * leeks
    * chives
    * shallots
    * scallions (all part of the allium family)  

get top billing in the quest to create healthy communication.  

## Do: Eat Prebiotic Fiber-Rich Plant Foods 
When you eat these foods, you can better reach the good bugs that have been cowering in the far reaches of your gut, sidelined because they lack the nutrients they need to do their job. Eating foods that are `rich in soluble` (and some **insoluble**) fibers, including tubers :  
* rutabagas
* parsnips
* radishes
* root vegetables
* radicchio
* endive
* okra
* artichokes
* pressure-cooked beans and legumes
* basil seeds
* flaxseeds
* psyllium and more

supports the health and reproduction of **healthy bacteria in your microbiome**. When your **gut buddies** get the sustenance they need, they’ll send messages to your brain **saying that their needs are being met**. As a result, you will literally feel less hungry and begin to crave more of the foods that are healthy for them—and therefore healthy for you.  

One of the best prebiotics is `inulin`, a type of dietary fiber found in foods such as chicory, asparagus, onions, leeks, and artichokes. As I mentioned earlier, one of the many benefits of consuming inulin is that your **gut buddies** use it to produce `plasmalogens` that protect your brain.  

Yet another great way to consume prebiotics is to take `psyllium` husk powder. Recent studies out of Stanford University have shown that psyllium husks **are superior** to inulin powder in promoting gut buddy diversity. Or try my new favorite, `soaked basil seeds`. As many of you know, `chia seeds` are loaded with **lectins**. But `basil seeds` provide all the benefits of forming a `prebiotic gel` without the dangers of `chia lectins`. Start with a **teaspoon** a day, mixed into water or not, and work up to a daily tablespoon or even two for maximum effect.  

## Do: Choose Organic Produce
To fully benefit from your plant foods, choose **organic** products as much as you can. Conventionally grown crops are sprayed with pesticides, including Roundup, which kill off your **gut buddies** and cause so **many of the diseases** I’ve discussed throughout the book. Buying organic produce really does make a difference. Studies confirm that consuming organic plant foods reduces the pesticide load in children.  

## Do: Eat Whole Foods
Whole foods provide your **gut buddies** with `resistant starches`. Because they **resist quick digestion**, these starches can make it **past** your small intestine without being absorbed and into your `large intestine`, where your **gut buddies** will convert them into important messaging signals such as `butyrate`. Yams, taro root, sorghum, millet, pressure-cooked rice, and cassava can all be transformed into `resistant starches` when they are cooked, chilled, and reheated.  

Let me be clear: all of these **starch-containing** plant products are still made of **sugars** that are bound together in chains by chemical bonds. **Cooking breaks the bonds**, but you can remake a number of them by **chilling** the foods after cooking, then **reheating** them before consuming. This simple, easy trick often makes a `big difference`, especially in my metabolically inflexible patients.  

The more plant material remains in its **original form—whole**, if you will—the more **resistant it will be to digestion** (and **therefore the more usable by your gut buddies**). For example, a yam that was cooked, cooled, and reheated is going to be much more resistant than sweet potato flour or pasta.  

I should also add that popular root vegetables, including beets and carrots, contain complex carbohydrates and resistant starches—when they are raw. Unfortunately, if you cook them, even a little, they lose those components.

## Do: Eat for Your Mitochondria
Your `mitochondria` need two special substances to protect them from oxidative stress:  
* the antioxidant melatonin
* as well as a range of healthy fats, including phospholipids, a special type of fat molecule found in egg yolks, fish, and other foods.  

Though your **gut buddies** can make melatonin from amino acids, a boost of food-sourced melatonin **ensures** that your mitochondria will be **protected**. Luckily, getting your melatonin couldn’t be easier or more delicious. The foods on the list below contain **high levels** of `melatonin`. Please pressure-cook, cool, and reheat the types of rice listed below. `Melatonin` not only cleans reactive oxygen species (ROSs) from your `mitochondria`; it also works as an **uncoupler** in its own right. The following foods contain high levels of melatonin (listed from highest to lowest melatonin content).  

| Melatonin-Rich Foods                 |
| ------------------------------------ |
| Pistachios                           |
| Mushrooms                            |
| Black pepper                         |
| Red rice                             |

| Brewed coffee                        |
| Red wine                             |
| Cranberries                          |
| Almonds                              |
| Basmati rice                         |
| Purslane (the weed the Ikarians eat) |
| Tart cherries                        |
| Strawberries                         |
| Flaxseed                             |  

Now let’s get to healthy fats. `Phospholipids` and the short- and long- chain `omega-3` and long-chain `omega-6` fatty acids all help keep mitochondrial membranes in tip-top shape to ensure that `ATP production` can function without a **hitch**. In addition, these fats house the uncoupling proteins in the mitochondrial membranes, even as they promote uncoupling themselves. The best sources of the short-chain omega-3 fat alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) are   
* perilla seed oil
* flaxseed oil
* ahiflower seed oil
* organic canola (rapeseed) oil  

`Perilla` seed oil has been shown to improve microbiome and gut wall function in athletes!   

Luckily, `phospholipids` are plentiful in shellfish such as mussels, scallops, clams, oysters, shrimp, crab, squid, and lobster. Omega-3 `egg yolks` also have generous amounts of short-chain omega-3s, as well as being a rich source of `arachidonic acid` (AA), a type of long-chain omega-6 fatty acid. `Olive oil` is also a great source of the fats and polyphenols you need to keep your microbiome in balance.  

## Do: Drink Alcohol (in Moderation)
I’m ending the list of dos on a high note, but keep reading before you get too excited. Yes, some types of alcohol such as `red wine` and `champagne` do contain `powerful prefermented polyphenols`. But consuming too much alcohol is never a good thing, and you must choose wisely. The grapes used to make some wines are **sprayed** with gut buddy–`destroying pesticides`, so always choose **organic** or biodynamic wine.  

It’s also important to **limit** your portions. I recommend that **women** consume **no more** than **118ml to 177ml** of organic or biodynamic red wine or champagne with dinner. **Men can double** this amount. If you prefer **spirits**, you can have 29.57ml of your favorite dark spirit during your evening meal. Why a dark spirit and not clear alcohol such as vodka or gin? Because **dark spirits** have been **aged in wood casks**, and in the process, they’ve **absorbed polyphenols from the wood**!  

## Don’t: Eat Lectin-Rich Plant Foods
Though it’s important to eat plant foods that are rich in `prebiotic fiber`, it’s equally important to **avoid lectin-heavy veggies, grains**, and improperly prepared `legumes`. Remember, `lectins` are one of the **main culprits in causing leaky gut**. Once your gut wall has been made permeable, `lectins` can go on to damage your `internal organs` and `joint tissues`, leading to autoimmune disorders including :  
* rheumatoid arthritis
* Hashimoto thyroiditis
* diabetes
* coronary artery disease  

Perhaps the most damaging type of `lectin` is `WGA`, which is small enough to sneak through an intact gut wall and sticks to the `glycocalyx linings` of your arteries, joints, and/or protecting your brain. There is no place for **whole grains** containing `WGA` on the program.  

Remarkably, `WGA` is in the outer part of wheat, rye, and barley, and a similar compound exists in corn and rice hulls. Think for a moment aboutall the trouble that people around the world have gone to in order to remove that outer hull. People in Asian cultures **eat white rice**, not brown. People in cultures who ate corn traditionally **soaked** it in lime or lye to **remove the hulls**. That resulted in **hominy**, which in turn became masa flour and was used to make **tortillas**.  

Where do we even start with the history of trying to make `white flour` from whole wheat flour? Why is Italian pasta white, not whole wheat? Why? Because the **milling** process eliminates a major cause of damage to the `glycocalyx` of blood vessels, joints, and the `blood-brain barrier`. Remember, `WGA` is a **foreign antigen** and inside your body is attacked like a **splinter**. Is it any wonder, then, that "whole grain goodness" resulted in **a wave of arthritis, heart disease, and dementia**?  

`Lectins` are also **found** in **nightshade vegetables** and **pseudograins** including :  
* white potatoes
* tomatoes
* peppers
* eggplant
* and goji berries
* brown rice
* beans and lentils
* grains
* amaranth
* quinoa
* buckwheat
* peanuts
* cashews
* chia seeds

The **good news** is that most lectin-containing foods **can be consumed** after being `pressure-cooked—or fermented`! Let those **gut buddies** eat your lectins for you!  

## Don’t: Eat Processed Foods
Remember, you are no longer eating for you; **you are eating for your gut buddies**. If you are worried that you’ll have trouble giving up your favorite junk foods, keep in mind that you crave those foods because your gut is currently in a state of `dysbiosis`. The bad guys that thrive on those foods have hijacked the communication systems to your brain, and they are telling it that you want more of them. Once you feed your gut buddies what they need and allows them to grow, healthy communication will be restored, and you will start desiring the foods that are best for them—and for you.  

In addition, `processed foods` are typically full of **polyunsaturated omega-6 fats** from soybean and corn oils, which destroy your **gut buddies** ability to make `hydrogen sulfide`, a `postbiotic gasotransmitter` that helps `alleviate inflammation` in the gut. **Processed** and **fried foods** are also hidden sources of `trans fats`, those now-banned fats that somehow still sneak into our food supply. This type of fat, created during industrial processing, clogs and **damages** the inner membranes of your mitochondria.  

Perhaps even worse, the short-chain **omega-6** fat linoleic acid (`LA`) is the most **prevalent fat** in most industrial seed oils, including soy, corn, cottonseed, sunflower, safflower, and grape seed oil. When heated, this is transformed into `aldehydes`, one of the **most toxic compounds** to your `mitochondrial` function yet **discovered**. One way of protecting yourself is to look for the words contains one or more of these vegetable oils. If you see those words, put the bottle down and walk away.  

Finally, processed foods are chock full of chemicals such as food colorings, artificial sweeteners, and high-fructose corn syrup, all of which damage our `microbiomes`. A single packet of an **artificial sweetener** such as sucralose (Splenda) has the power to **kill half of the intestinal bacteria living in your gut**. Half! Likewise, **titanium dioxide**, a common additive used as a whitening agent in personal care products such as sunscreens as well as in the powdered sugary topping found on many `doughnuts`, has been shown to **alter** the composition of your `microbiome` and cause inflammation. Your gut buddies need real food. Give them what they want, and no one will get hurt—at least not you!  

## Don’t: Overdo It on the Fruit
Yes, many fruits do contain `polyphenols`, so at first glance you may assume that eating plenty of fruit is a great idea. Well, you know what they say about what happens when you assume that if some is good, more is better.  

The biggest issue with fruit is that it has a `high fructose` content, which is a **mitochondrial toxin** and causes changes in the `microbiome`. It reduces diversity, feeds gang members, and **contributes** to `leaky gut`. Fructose also **hampers gasotransmitter** production and causes defective insulin signaling, leading to insulin resistance; it even causes insulin resistance in kids! **Are you still sure** your kids need a juice box at snack time?  

Yes, fruit is "nature’s candy", and that’s exactly the problem: it basically is candy! Historically, humans were exposed to fruit only during a limited time period each year. For that reason, it’s **fine to eat local fruit** in season. I have blackberry and blueberry bushes in my yard, and I enjoy the berries during the six to eight weeks a year they grow. But it’s not natural or healthy to have fruit available at any moment year-round.  

Even worse, our fruit has now been **bred** to be **even sweeter** than is natural, with higher levels of fructose. Modern fruit, with a few exceptions, **is not your microbiome friend**. When in season, `pomegranate` and `passion fruit` seeds have a very low sugar content and are **good choices**. `Kiwi` fruit (skin on, please! It’s loaded with fiber and polyphenols) and `grapefruit` are both low in sugar and laden with `polyphenols`.  

## Don’t: Eat Sugar
Remember, your gut is home to some potentially harmful bacteria. That’s okay. When our **gut buddies** are well nourished, we don’t have to worry about the gang members because the good bacteria will keep them in balance. But unfortunately, the `bad guys thrive` on `saturated fats` and `simple sugars`. When you make these types of foods mainstays of your diet, you give sustenance to the bad bacteria, **enabling them to grow** in size and number and produce LPSs, causing inflammation, all while starving out all those good bacteria that your health relies on.  

Luckily for those of us with a sweet tooth, there are healthy ways to satisfy it. The best alternative for your **gut buddies** is non-GMO `allulose`, a naturally occurring sugar that doesn’t impact `blood sugar` or `insulin` levels. Even better, your **gut buddies** love the stuff. `Allulose` causes positive changes to the microbiome and **reduces inflammation**. When **mice** are given allulose, they produce more `SCFAs`. That’s a win for both your sweet tooth and your gut buddies.  

## Don’t: Eat Too Much or Too Little Protein
Besides all of the issues with `Neu5Gc`, the problem with high-protein diets is that they deprive your **gut buddies** of the fiber and polyphenols they need to thrive and communicate with your `mitochondria`. In fact, mitochondrial function generally starts to plummet within days of starting a high-protein diet. When you eat **too much protein**, your gut buddies start producing `fewer SCFAs`, including `butyrate`, have no `polyphenols` to eat and activate, and begin **producing** more **damaging compounds**.  

Remember, overconsumption of animal protein can also cause your gut buddies to make too much `hydrogen sulfide`, which **damages your cells**.  

> Once again, we see the Goldilocks effect: though hydrogen sulfide is generally beneficial, there can be too much of a good thing.  

## THE GUT CHECK FOOD LISTS
Hopefully, this all seems pretty straightforward. To make things even easier for you I’ve created the following **yes** and **no** lists..

Now you know about all the foods that your **gut buddies** do and don’t want to eat. Perhaps it’s a good time to remind yourself why you are doing all of this. You’ve learned that the complex `galaxy living` in your body controls just about everything that’s going to happen to you. This **galaxy** far and away outnumbers your human cells and human genetic material. Yet you’ve also read about all of the ways we’ve ignored, abused, and outright killed these `microbes`. They’re mad as hell, and they’re not going to take it anymore.  

The good news is that you have the power to **rectify** the situation. You can undo the damage that’s been done to your inner ecosystem, and it’s not all that difficult. If you still don’t think that’s necessary, all I have left to tell you is a quote from yet another one of my favorite movies  

> Dirty Harry: "You’ve got to ask yourself one question: Do I feel lucky?"

Well, do you, punk? What do you say? I say, let’s eat!

## The Meandering Small Intestine

The small intestine meanders about in our abdominal cavity, twisting and turning for a distance of between 3 and 6 meters. Most people do not realize that only the final last meter of our large intestine has anything to do with feces—the preceding sections of our intestinal tract are surprisingly clean (and largely smell-free, incidentally). Our gut faithfully and tastefully takes on everything we swallow down to it. At first sight, the small intestine seems rather more haphazard in its design than our other organs. The heart has its four chambers, the liver has its lobes, veins have valves, and the brain has specialized areas—but the small intestine just wanders aimlessly about in our abdomen. Its true design becomes clear at the microscopic level. We have here a creaturethat epitomizes the phrase **love of detail**.

Our gut wants to offer us as much surface area as possible. That is why it loves folds—including the folds we can see with the naked eye. Without folds, our small intestine would need to be up to 18 meters long to provide us with enough surface area for our digestion. 

Each square inch of its surface contains about 20,000 tiny fingerlike projections (or about 30 projections per square millimeter). These projections, called villi by scientists, protrude out into the mush of partly digested food, the medical word for which is “chyme.” The villi’s size means they appear as a velvety structure to the unaided human eye. Under the microscope, the little villi look like large waves made out of cells. (Velvet looks verysimilar under a microscope.) Even greater magnification reveals that each and every one of those cells is itself covered with little protrusions-the microvilli: villi on villi, if you like. The microvilli are, in turn, covered with a velvety meshwork made of countless sugar-based structures that look a little bit like antlers. These are called the glycocalyxes. If all this— the folds, the villi, and the microvilli—were ironed out to a smooth surface, our small intestine would have to be some 7 kilometers long.

Why does the small intestine have to be so huge, anyway? In total, the surface area of our digestive system is about one hundred times greater than the area of our skin. That seems a little excessive just to deal with a small portion of fries or a single apple. But this is what it’s all about inside our belly: we enlarge ourselves as much as possible in order to reduce anything from outside to the smallest size we can, until it is so tiny that our body can absorb it and it eventually becomes a part of us.

We begin that process in the mouth. A bite of an apple sounds like such a juicy idea because, when we take that bite, our teeth burst millions of apple cells like tiny balloons. The fresher the apple is, the more of its cells remain intact—which is why we can tell how fresh the fruit is by its crispness as we bite into it.

Just as we prefer crisp, fresh fruit, we also love hot, protein-rich food. We find steak, scrambled eggs, or fried tofu more appetizing than raw meat, slimy eggs, or cold bean curd. That’s because we have an intuitive understanding of how digestion works. If we swallow a raw egg, it will undergo the same processes in our stomach as it would in the frying pan.

If we were to vomit the raw egg back up after the right amount of time, the results would look like almost perfect scrambled eggs—without any cooking! Proteins react to the heat in the hot pan and the acid in our stomach in the same way—they unfold. That means they no longer possess the clever design features that make them soluble in the liquid of the egg white, so they form solid white lumps. In this state, they can be digested far more easily in the stomach and the small intestine. Cooking food saves us the whole first burst of energy required to unfold those proteins, which would otherwise have to be expended by the stomach. By preferring cooked food, the body outsources the first part of the digestive process.

The final breakdown of the food we eat takes place in the small intestine. It is through this little hole that digestive juices are squirted onto the chyme. As soon as we eat something, the liver and pancreas begin to produce these juices and deliver them to the papilla. These juices contain the same agents as the laundry detergent and dish soap you can buy from any supermarket: digestive enzymes and fat solvents. Laundry detergent is effective in removing stains because it “digests out” any fatty, protein-rich, or sugary substances from your laundry, with a little help from the movement of the washing-machine drum, leaving these substances free to be rinsed down the drain with the dirty water. That is more or less the same as what happens in our small intestine. The main difference is that the pieces of protein, fat, or carbohydrates that are broken down in the intestine ready to be transported to the bloodstream through the gut wall are huge by comparison. A bite of an apple is then no longer a bite of apple, but a nutritious pulp made up of billions and billions of energy-rich molecules. Absorbing them all requires a huge surface area-a length of 7 kilometers is just about enough. That also leaves some space as a safety buffer, in case parts of the gut are temporarily put out of action by infection or gastric flu.

Each individual villus contains a tiny blood vessel—a capillary-that is fed with the absorbed molecules. All the small intestine’s blood vessels eventually come together and carry the blood to the liver, where the nutrients are screened for harmful substances and toxins. Any dangerous substances can be destroyed here before the blood passes into the main circulatory system. If we eat too much, this is where the first energy stores are created. The nutrient-rich blood then flows from the liver directly to the heart. There, it receives a powerful push and is pumped to the countless cells of our body.

That releases energy, which the cell uses to stay alive, with heat and tiny amounts of water created as byproducts. This happens inside so many cells at the same time that the heat produced keeps our body at a constant temperature of 36 to 37 degrees Celsius.

The basic principle underlying our energy metabolism is simple. Nature requires energy to ripen an apple on the tree. We humans come along and break the apple down into its constituent molecules and metabolize them for energy. We then use the energy released to keep us alive. All the organs that develop out of that embryonic gut tube are able to provide fuel for our cells. 

So, all our body’s organs use up energy, but it is from the small intestine that we start to get some energy back. That explains why eating is such a pleasant pastime. However, we can’t expect to feel a burst of energy as soon as we have swallowed the last mouthful of a meal. In fact, many people find they feel tired and sluggish after eating. The food has not yet reached the small intestine—it is still in the preparatory stages of digestion. We no longer feel hungry because our stomach has been expanded by the food we’ve eaten. But we feel just as sluggish as we did before the meal, and now we have to come up with the extra energy for all that mixing and breaking down. To achieve this, a large amount of blood is delivered to our digestive organs, and many researchers also believe that postprandial tiredness may be due to the resulting reduced blood supply to the brain.  

## The Unnecessary Appendix and the Bulgy Large Intestine

Our appendix, officially known as the vermiform, or worm-shaped, appendix, has a reputation for being useless. the appendix is not only too small to deal with chyme, it is also positioned in a location that partly digested food hardly ever reaches. It is just below the junction between the small and large intestines, and is completely bypassed.

Our large intestine takes care of things that cannot be absorbed in the small intestine. For that reason, it does not have the same velvety texture. It would simply be a waste of energy and resources to fill this part of the gut with absorbent villi. Instead, the large intestine is the home of most of our gut bacteria, which can break down the last nutritious substances for us. And our immune system is very interested in these bacteria. So, the vermiform appendix couldn’t be better placed. It is far enough away so as not to be bothered by all the digestive business going on above it, but close enough to monitor all foreign microbes. Although the walls of the large intestine include large deposits of immune cells, the appendix is made almost entirely of immune tissue. So, if a bad germ comes by, it is surrounded. However, that also means that everything around it can become infected—360-degree, panoramic inflammation, so to speak. If this inflammation causes the appendix to swell, the little tube has problems sweeping itself clean of those bad germs—leading to one of the more than 270,000 appendectomies carried out every year in the United States alone.

However, that is not the only function of the appendix. It leaves only good germs alive and attacks anything it sees as dangerous, and this also means a healthy appendix acts as a storehouse of all the best, most helpful bacteria. 

Its practicality comes into play after a heavy bout of diarrhea. That will often flush away many of the typical gut microbes, leaving the terrain free for other bacteria to settle. This should not be left to chance. And this is when, the appendix team steps in and spreads out protectively throughout the entire large intestine.

## What We Really Eat

The most important phase of our digestion takes place in the small intestine, where the maximum surface area meets the maximum reduction of our food down to the tiniest pieces. Here, in this final stage of breakdown, our digestive enzymes work like tiny pairs of scissors. They snip away at our food until it shares a lowest common denominator with our cells. Basic ingredients: sugar molecules, amino acids, and fats. There is no difference between an apple, a tree, and a cow.

Sugar molecules can be linked to form complex chains. When that happens, they no longer taste sweet, and we know them as the carbohydrates we find in bread, pasta, or rice. After that piece of toast you ate for breakfast has undergone the snipping of the enzyme scissors, the final product is the same number of sugar molecules as a couple of spoonfuls of refined household sugar. The only difference is that household sugar does not require so much work from our enzymes as it is already broken down into such small pieces when it arrives in the small intestine that it can be absorbed directly into the bloodstream.

The sugar contained in white toast is digested relatively quickly by our enzymes. With wholegrain bread, everything moves at a much more leisurely pace. Such bread contains particularly complex sugar chains, which have to be broken down bit by bit. So, wholegrain bread is not a sugar explosion, but a beneficial sugar store. Incidentally, our body has to work much harder to restore a healthy balance if a sugar onrush comes suddenly. It pumps out large amounts of various hormones, most importantly insulin. The result is that we rapidly feel tired again once this special operation is over.

Despite the problems, our body loves sugary sweet treats because they save the body work, since sugar can be taken up more quickly. The same is true of warm proteins. In addition, sugar can be turned into energy extremely quickly, and our brain rewards us for a rush of rapid energy by making us feel good. Some 80 percent of the processed foods found on the shelves of modern-day American supermarkets contain added sugar.

When we eat too much sugar, our body simply stores it away for leaner times. Quite practical, really. One way the body does this is by relinking the molecules to form long, complex chains of a substance called glycogen, which is then stored in the liver. Another strategy is to convert the excess sugar into fat and store it in fatty tissue. Sugar is the only substance our body can turn into fat with little effort.

Glycogen reserves are soon used up—just about the time during your run when you notice the exercise is suddenly much harder work. That is why nutritional physiologists say we should do at least an hour’s exercise if we want to burn fat. 

We use fat to coat our nerves—just like the plastic on an electric cable. It is this coating that makes us such fast thinkers. Some of the most important hormones in our body are made out of fat, and every single one of our cells is wrapped in a membrane made largely of fat. 

Our small intestine also knows the special value of fat. Unlike other nutrients, it cannot be absorbed straight into the blood from the gut. Fat is not soluble in water—it would immediately clog the tiny blood capillaries in the villi of the gut and float on top of the blood in larger vessels, like the oil on spaghetti water. So fat must be absorbed via a different route: the lymphatic system. Lymphatic vessels are to blood vessels as Robin is to Batman. Every blood vessel inside the body is accompanied by a lymphatic vessel, even each tiny capillary in the small intestine. While our blood vessels are thick and red and heroically pump nutrients to our tissues, the lymphatic vessels are thin and filmy white in color. They drain away fluid that is pumped out of our tissue and transport the immune cells, whose job it is to ensure that everything is as it should be throughout the body.

Lymphatic vessels are so slight because they do not have muscular walls like our blood vessels. Often, they work just by using gravity. That explains why we sometimes wake up in the morning with swollen eyes. Gravity is not very much help when you are lying down. The tiny lymphatic vessels in our face are nicely open, but it is only when we get up and gravity kicks in that the fluid transported there during the night by our blood vessels can flow back down.

The lymphatic system is seen as an under-appreciated weakling everywhere in the body except in the small intestine. This is its time to shine! All the body’s lymph vessels converge in an impressively thick duct, where all the digested fat can gather without the risk of clogging.

Shortly after we eat a fatty meal, there are so many tiny fat droplets in our ductus or thoracic duct that the lymph fluid is no longer transparent but milky white. When the fat has gathered, the thoracic duct skirts the belly, passes through the diaphragm, and heads straight for the heart. (All the fluid drained from our legs, eyelids, and gut ends up here.) So, whether it’s extra virgin olive oil or cheap fat from french fries, it all goes straight into the heart—there is no detoxing detour via the liver as there is for everything else we digest.

Detoxification of dangerous, bad fat takes place only after the heart has given the fat-laden fluid a powerful push to pump it through the system and the droplets of fat happen to end up in one of the blood vessels of the liver. The liver contains quite a large amount of blood, and so the probability is high that such a meeting will take place sooner rather than later, but before that happens, our heart and our blood vessels are at the mercy of everything that McDonald’s and similar fast-food outlets were able to get hold of at the lowest purchase price.

Just as bad fat can have a negative effect, good fat can work wonders. Those who are prepared to spend that little bit extra on cold-pressed (extra virgin) olive oil will be dunking their baguette in a soothing balm for theirheart and blood vessels. Many studies have been carried out into the effects of olive oil, and results show that it can protect against arteriosclerosis, cellular stress, Alzheimer’s, and eye diseases such as macular degeneration. It also appears to have beneficial effects on inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and help in protecting against certain kinds of cancer. Of particular interest to those fighting fat is that olive oil also has the potential to help get rid of that spare tire. It blocks an enzyme in fatty tissue—known as fatty acid synthase—that likes to create fat out of spare carbohydrates. And we are not the only ones who benefit from the properties of olive oil—the good bacteria in our gut also appreciate a little pampering. Good-quality olive oil costs a little bit more. However, it tastes neither greasy nor rancid, but rather green and fruity, and it sometimes leaves a peppery feeling in your throat after you swallow it. This is due to the tannins it contains.

The animal fats found in meat, milk, and eggs contain far more arachidonic acid than vegetable fats. Arachidonic acid is converted in our body into neurotransmitters involved in the sensation of pain. Oils such as rapeseed (canola), linseed, or hempseed oil, on the other hand, contain more of the anti-inflammatory substance alpha-linolenic acid, while olive oil contains a substance with a similar effect called oleocanthal. These fats work in a similar way to ibuprofen or aspirin, but in much smaller doses. So, although they are no help if you have an acute headache, using these oils regularly can help those who suffer from inflammatory disease,regular headaches, or menstrual pain. Sometimes, pain levels can be reduced somewhat simply by taking care to eat more vegetable fat than animal fat.

Nutritional physiologists recommend we get between 25 and a maximum of 30 percent of our daily energy requirement from fat. That works out at an average of 2 to 2½ ounces (55 to 66 grams) of fat a day. This means if you eat just one Big Mac, you will have conveniently covered half your daily requirement of fat—the only question is, with what kind of fat? A sweet onion chicken teriyaki sandwich from the fast-food chain Subway contains less than 1/6 of an ounce of fat (only 4.5 grams). How you consume the other 2 ounces (53 grams) is then entirely up to you.

It seems strange to imagine, but both tofu, with its neutral-to- nutty taste, and salty, savory meat are made up of lots of tiny acids. As with carbohydrates, these tiny building blocks are linked in chains. This is what gives them their different taste and a different name—proteins. Digestive enzymes break down these chains in the small intestine and then the gut wall nabs the valuable components. There are twenty of these amino acids and an infinite variety of ways they can be linked to form proteins. We humans use them to build many substances, not least of which is our DNA, the genetic material contained in every new cell we produce every day. 

However, maintaining a healthy meat-free diet that does not lead to nutritional deficiencies is more difficult than most people think. Plants construct different proteins than animals, and they often use so little of a given amino acid that the proteins they produce are known as incomplete. When our body tries to use these to make the amino acids it needs, it cancontinue to build the chain only until one of the amino acids runs out. Half-finished proteins are then simply broken down again, and we excrete the tiny acids in our urine or recycle them in our body. Beans lack the amino acid methionine; rice and wheat (and its derivative meat substitute, seitan) lack lysine; and sweetcorn is, in fact, deficient in two amino acids: lysine and tryptophan. But this does not spell the final triumph of the meat eaters over the meat-avoiders. Vegetarians and vegans simply have to be cleverer in combining their foods.

Beans may be lacking in methionine, but they are packed with lysine. A wheat tortilla with refried beans and a yummy filling will provide all the amino acids the body needs for healthy protein production. Vegetarians who eat cheese and eggs can compensate for incomplete proteins that way. For centuries in many countries around the world, people have intuitively eaten meals made up of foodstuffs that complement each other: rice and beans, pasta with cheese, pita bread and hummus, or peanut butter on toast. In theory, combining does not even have to take place within one meal. It is enough to take in the right combination over the course of a day. There are plants that do contain all the necessary amino acids in the necessary quantities. Two of these are soy and quinoa, but others include amaranth, spirulina, buckwheat, and chia seeds. Tofu has a well- deserved reputation as an alternative to meat—with the caveat that increasing numbers of people are developing allergic reactions to it.  

## Allergies and Intolerances

One theory about the origin of allergies begins with the digestive processes in the small intestine. If we fail to break down a protein into its constituent amino acids, tiny bits of it will remain. Under normal circumstances, those tiny particles simply don’t make it into our bloodstream and there is no problem. However, hidden power often lies in the most inconspicuous places—in this case, in the lymphatic system. Those tiny particles can enter the lymphatic system, embedded in fat droplets, and once there, they attract the attention of ever-vigilant immune cells. When the immune cells discover a tiny particle of peanut in the lymphatic fluid, for example, they naturally attack it as a foreign body. The next time the immune cells encounter a peanut particle, they are better prepared to deal with it and can attack it more aggressively. And so it goes on, until we reach the stage where just putting a peanut in our mouth causes our immune cells to whip out the big guns straightaway. The result is increasingly severe allergic reactions, such as extreme swelling of the face and tongue. This explanation applies to allergies caused by foods that are both fatty and rich in protein, such as milk, eggs, and, most commonly, peanuts. There is a simple reason almost no one is allergic to greasy bacon. We are made of meat ourselves, and so we generally have few problems digesting it.  

## Celiac Disease and Gluten Sensitivity

Allergies that develop in the small intestine are not limited to fats. Allergens such as prawns, pollen, or gluten, for example, are not, in themselves, fat-bombs, and people who eat a fatty diet do not necessarily suffer from more allergies than others. Another theory about how allergies develop is this: the wall of our gut can become temporarily more porous, allowing food remnants to enter the tissue of the gut and the bloodstream. This is the theory under most scrutiny from researchers who are interested in gluten—a protein found in wheat and related grains.

Grains do not like us to eat them. What plants really want is to reproduce—and then along we come and eat their children. Instead of creating an emotional scene, plants respond by making their seeds slightly poisonous. That sounds much more drastic than it is—neither side is going to lose much sleep over a few guzzled wheat grains. The arrangement means humans and plants both survive well enough. But, the more danger a plant senses, the more poisonous it will make its seeds. Wheat, in particular, is such a worrier because it has only a very short window of opportunity for its seeds to grow and carry on the family line. With such a tight schedule, nothing must be allowed to go wrong. In insects, gluten has the effect of inhibiting an important digestive enzyme. A greedy grasshopper might be put off by a little stomachache after eating too much wheat, and that is to the benefit of both plant and animal.

In humans, gluten can pass into the cells of the gut in a partially undigested state. There, it can slacken the connections between individual cells. This allows wheat proteins to enter areas they have no business being in. That, in turn, raises the alarm in our immune system. One person in a hundred has a genetic intolerance to gluten (celiac disease), but a considerably higher proportion suffer from gluten sensitivity.

In patients with celiac disease, eating wheat can cause serious infections or damage to the villi of the gut wall; it can also damage the nervous system. Celiac disease can cause diarrhea and failure to thrive in children, who may show reduced growth or winter pallor. The tricky thing about celiac disease is that it can appear in more or less pronounced forms. Those with more subtle forms may live with the symptoms for years without realizing it. They may have the occasional stomachache, or their doctor might discover signs of anemia during routine blood tests. Currently, the most effective treatment is a lifelong gluten-free diet.

Gluten sensitivity, by contrast, is not a sentence to a life of gluten avoidance. Those with this condition can eat wheat without risking serious damage to their small intestine, but they should enjoy wheat products in moderation—a little bit like our friend the greedy grasshopper. Many people notice their sensitivity when they swear off gluten for a week or two and see an improvement in their general well-being. Suddenly, their digestive problems or flatulence clear up, or they have fewer headaches or less painful joints. Some people find that their powers of concentration improve, or that they are less plagued by tiredness or fatigue. Researchers began exploring gluten sensitivity in detail only recently. Currently, the diagnostic picture can be summarized as follows. Symptoms improve when a gluten-free diet is introduced, although tests for celiac diseaseshow negative. The villi are not inflamed or damaged, but eating too much bread still appears to have an unpleasant effect on the immune system.

The gut can also become porous for a short time after a course of antibiotics, after a heavy bout of drinking alcohol, or as a result of stress. Sensitivity to gluten resulting from these temporary causes can sometimes look the same as the symptoms of true gluten intolerance. In such cases, it can be helpful to avoid gluten for a time. A thorough medical examination and the detection of certain molecules on the surface of the blood corpuscles are important for a definitive diagnosis. Alongside the familiar blood groups A, B, AB, and O, there are many other **indicators** for categorizing human blood, including what doctors call `DQ` markers. Those who do not belong to group `DQ2` or `DQ8` are extremely unlikely to have celiac disease.  

## Lactose Intolerance and Fructose Intolerance

Lactose intolerance is not an allergy or a real intolerance at all, but a deficiency. But it, too, results from a failure to break down certain nutrients completely into their component parts. Lactose is found in milk. It is derived from two sugar molecules that are linked together by chemical bonds. The body requires a digestive enzyme to break that bond, but, unlike other enzymes, this one does not come from the papilla. The cells of the small intestine secrete it themselves on the tips of their tiny little villi. Lactose breaks down when it comes into contact with the enzyme on the gut wall, and the resulting single sugars can then be absorbed. If the enzyme is missing, similar problems arise to those caused by gluten intolerance or gluten sensitivity, including bellyache, diarrhea, and flatulence. Unlike in celiac disease, however, no undigested lactose particles pass through the gut wall. They simply move on down the line, into the large intestine, where they become food for the gas-producing bacteria there. Consider the resulting flatulence and other unpleasant symptoms as votes of thanks from extremely satisfied, overfed microbes. Although the results can be unpleasant, lactose intolerance is far less harmful to health than undiagnosed celiac disease.

## A Few Facts About Feces

Feces are primarily water, making up about three-quarters (75%) of their total volume. We lose around 100 milliliters of fluid a day. During digestion, particularly in the large intestine, about 9.8 liters of water are typically reabsorbed from the digestive contents. This process helps to prevent dehydration and ensures that only a small amount of water is lost in the stool.. A third of the solid components are bacteria. They are gut flora that have ended their careers in the digestive business and are ready to retire from the workplace. Another third is made up of indigestible vegetable fiber. The more fruit and vegetables you eat, the more feces you excrete per bowel movement. Increasing the proportion of that food group in the diet can raise the weight of a bowel movement from the average 100 to 200 grams to as much as 500 grams per day. The remaining third is a mixed bag. It is made up of substances that the body wants to get rid of—such as the remains of medicines, food coloring, or cholesterol.

The natural color of human feces ranges from brown to yellowish-brown —even when we have not eaten anything of this color. The same is true of our urine—it always tends toward yellow. This is due to a very important product that we manufacture fresh every day: blood. Our bodies create 2.4 million new blood corpuscles a day. But the same number are broken down every day, too. In that process, the red pigment they contain is first turned green, then yellow. You can see the same process in the various stages of a bruise on your skin. A small portion of this yellow pigment is excreted in your urine. Most of it, though, passes through the liver and into the gut. There, bacteria change its color once again—this time turning it brown. Examining the color of feces can provide a useful insight into the goings- on of our gut.

A healthy digestive system, producing feces with the optimum water content, will produce `types 3 or 4`. The other types are less than ideal. 

![img](../assets/feces.jpg)

Those who find `types 3 or 4` in the toilet bowl may also want to observe how quickly their feces sink in water. Ideally, they should not plummet straight to the bottom, as this would indicate the possibility that they still contain nutrients that have not been digested properly. Feces that sink slowly contain bubbles of gas that keep them afloat in water. These gas bubbles are produced by gut bacteria that mostly perform useful services. So this is a good sign, as long as it is not accompanied by flatulence.  

## The Nervous System of the Gut

The gut is cosseted by no fewer than three coats of smooth muscle tissue. This makes it incredibly supple and able to execute different choreographies in different places. The choreographer directing these muscles is the gut’s own (enteric) nervous system. The enteric nervous system controls all processes that take place in the digestive tract, and it is extraordinarily autonomous. If the connection between the enteric nervoussystem and the brain is severed, the digestive tract carries blithely on as if nothing has happened. This property is unique to the enteric nervous system and is found nowhere else in the human body—without directions from our brain, our legs would be lame and our lungs would no longer be able to breathe. It is a shame that we are oblivious to the workings of these independent-minded nerve fibers. Burping or breaking wind might sound a bit gross, but the movements involved are as delicate and complex as those of a ballerina.  

## How Our Organs Transport Food

### Stomach

A piece of cake can really get things going in the belly region. The stomach will churn it for about two hours, grinding the mouthfuls into tiny particles, most of them less than one-twelfth of an inch (about 2 millimeters) in size. Scraps of that size are no longer lobbed against the stomach wall, but slip through a little hole at the end of the stomach. This hole is the next sphincter—the doorman who guards the stomach’s exit and the entrance to the small intestine. Simple carbohydrates such as sponge cake, rice, or pasta make it through to the small intestine pretty quickly. There, they are digested and rapidly cause an increase in the levels of sugar in our blood. The doorman detains proteins and fats in the stomach for considerably longer. A piece of steak may easily be churned about for six hours before all of it hasdisappeared into the small intestine. This explains why we often fancy a sweet dessert after eating meat or fatty, fried foods. Our blood sugar levels are impatient and want to rise quickly, and dessert provides a quick blood sugar fix. Meals rich in carbohydrates may perk us up more quickly, but they do not keep us feeling full for as long as meaty or fatty meals.

### Small Intestine

When the mini-morsels reach the small intestine, the real process of digestion begins. The small intestine pluckily pounces on the piece of cake. It squeezes it, hashes it up from all sides, wiggles its villi in what we might now call the cake chyme, and when it is thoroughly mixed, moves it on down the digestive line. Under the microscope we can see that even the microvilli help it along! They move up and down like tiny trampling feet. Everything is in motion.

Whatever our small intestine does, it always obeys one basic rule: onward, ever onward! This is achieved by the peristaltic reflex. The man who first discovered this mechanism did so by isolating a piece of gut and blowing air into it through a small tube—and the friendly gut blew right back. This is why many doctors recommend a high-fiber diet to encourage digestion: indigestible fiber presses against the gut wall, which becomes intrigued and presses back. These gut gymnastics speed up the passage of food through the system and make sure the gut remains supple.

If our cake chyme were to listen carefully, it might hear a **heave!** The wall of the small intestine contains a particularly large number of pacemaker cells, which emit tiny bioelectric pulses. For the muscles of the gut, that is as if someone were to shout **heave!** and then again **heave!** In this way, the muscle is prevented from drifting off course, and it “heaves” back into place like a clubber on the dance floor responding to the beat. This keeps the piece of cake, or what’s left of it, moving unerringly onward.

The small intestine is the hardest-working part of our digestive tract, and it is very diligent about doing its job. There is only one unequivocal exceptional case when it does not see a digestive project through to the end: when we throw up. The small intestine is quite pragmatic when we need to vomit. It does not invest work in something that will not do us any good. It simply sends such stuff straight back by return mail.

Apart from a few remnants, our piece of cake has now disappeared entirely into the bloodstream. We could now follow those stragglers as they pass into the large intestine, but then we would miss a mysterious and oft-misunderstood creature that we can hear but not see.

After digestion, only a few rough leftovers remain in the stomach and small intestine—an unchewed kernel of corn, tablets coated to stop them dissolving in gastric juices, surviving bacteria from the food we have eaten, or a piece of chewing gum swallowed by mistake, for example. Now, the small intestine is a stickler for cleanliness. It is one of those types who clean up the kitchen right after a meal. If you were to pay your small intestine a visit just two hours after it has finished digesting something, you would find everything spick and span, with barely a whiff of what went on there a short time ago.

An hour after the small intestine has digested something, it begins the cleanup process. The scientific name for this process is “migrating motor complex.” When it kicks in, the stomach doorman is kind enough to open the gates again to allow these leftovers to be herded into the small intestine. It then moves them along with a wave powerful enough to sweep everything along with it. When observed with a camera, this looks so cute that even sober-minded scientists can’t help but nickname the migrating motor complex the little **housekeeper**.

Everyone has heard their little housekeeper at work. It is the rumbling belly, which, contrary to popular belief, does not come mainly from the stomach, but from the small intestine. Our bellies don’t rumble when we’re hungry, but when there is a long enough break between meals to finally get some cleaning done! When the stomach and the small intestine are both empty, the coast is clear for the housekeeper to do its work. If the stomach is involved in the lengthy process of grinding down a steak, the housekeeper just has to be patient. Only after six hours of churning in the stomach and around five hours of digesting in the small intestine is the steak safely gone and the housekeeper can start clearing up. We don’t necessarily always hear the housekeeper at work. It depends on how much air has found its way into the stomach and the small intestine. If we eat something before the cleanup is finished, the housekeeper immediately stops working and returns to waiting mode. Food needs to be digested in peace and not swept ahead too soon in a cleaning frenzy. Constant snacking means there is no time for cleaning. This is part of the reason some nutritional scientists recommend we leave five hours between meals. There is no scientific evidence proving that the interval must be preciselyfive hours. Those who chew their food thoroughly create less work for their housekeeper and can listen to their belly when it tells them it’s time to eat again.

### Large Intestine

At the end of the small intestine is a structure known as Bauhin’s valve. It separates the small from the large intestine, which is good because the two neighbors have very different ideas about work ethics. The large intestine is a much more leisurely type. Its motto is not really “onward, ever onward.” It is not averse to shifting what remains of our food backward as well as forward if that’s what feels right at the time. It has no busy little housekeeper. The large intestine is the tranquil home of our gut flora, which deal with anything that gets swept into the large intestine undigested.

The large intestine works at a more leisurely pace because it has to consider several different players. Our brain is picky about when it wants us to go to the toilet, the bacteria in our gut want ample time to deal with undigested food, and the rest of our body very much wants to get back the fluids it lent to the digestive system.

What makes it as far as the large intestine no longer resembles a piece of cake—nor should it. The unabsorbed remains of the cake may include a few fruit fibers from the cherry on the top, and the rest is made up ofdigestive juices, which are reabsorbed here. When we are anxious, our brain jockeys the large intestine along, leaving it without sufficient time to reabsorb all that fluid. The result is diarrhea.

Although the large intestine (like the small intestine) is a smooth tube, it is always shown in diagrams looking like a lumpy string of beads. Why is that? In fact, that is just what the large intestine looks like when the abdomen is opened up. The simple reason for this is that it is engaged in a slow-motion dance. Just like the small intestine, it bulges as it processes the food it receives, so as to hold it where it needs it to be. However, it tends to remain in one position for a long time without moving— something like those street mimes who stand in one statuesque pose until someone comes along and puts a coin in their hat. Every now and then, it relaxes and then forms bulges in other places. Then it remains in that configuration for a while. Anatomy books depict it in this way—like a child who blinks when the class photo is taken to appear in the yearbook looking dopey forevermore.

Two or three times a day, the large intestine stirs from its slumbers and gives an enthusiastic shove to the concentrated food mush to push it forward. Those who provide their large intestine with sufficient bulk may even have to go to the toilet two or three times a day. For most people, the content of their large intestine is enough for one bowel movement a day. But, statistically speaking, three times a day is still a healthy frequency.

The cake journey from fork to toilet takes one day on average. Faster guts accomplish this journey in eight hours; for slower digesters, it can take three and a half days. Due to all the mixing they undergo, some cake particles may linger in the chill-out space of the large intestine for twelve hours, while others might lounge around for up to forty-two hours. Leisurely digesters should not worry as long as the consistency of their bowel movements is fine and they have no other complaints. On the contrary, one Dutch study showed that those who belong to the once a day or less faction and those who have occasional constipation are less likely to contract certain rectal diseases. This is consistent with the motto of the large intestine, **Slow and steady wins the race**.

## Reflux

Its smooth muscle tissue can trip up just like the striated muscles of the legs. When that stumble causes a substance like gastric acid to reach places that are not designed to deal with it, it hurts. Reflux is the regurgitation of gastric acid and digestive enzymes into the pharyngeal area; in the case of heartburn, those juices travel no farther than the end of the esophagus, causing a burning sensation in the chest.

When the nerves of our digestive system receive incorrect information, they fail to keep our gastric juices where they belong and allow them to start moving in the wrong direction.

The crux of the matter is that two different nervous systems have to work together in the esophagus and stomach area—the nervous system of the brain and that of the gut. For example, the sphincter muscle between the esophagus and the stomach is under the control of nerves from the brain. The brain also influences gastric acid production. The nerves of the digestive tract ensure that the esophagus moves things downward in a harmonious stadium-style wave, keeping it clean with the thousand-or-so times we swallow saliva over the course of a day.

## The Brain and the Gut

A team of Chinese researchers managed to show in the laboratory that Lactobacillus reuteri is able to inhibit pain sensors in the gut.

Lactobacillus plantarum and Bifidobacterium infantis could already be recommended as a pain treatment for patients with irritable bowel syndrome. 

That might help with the symptoms, but it does not address the cause of the problem. If, after eliminating possible food intolerances and restocking the gut flora, there is still no improvement, then we must take the problem by the scruff of its neck—or in this case, by the nerve-cell threshold. So far, very few treatments have been scientifically proven to be effective. One of those is hypnotherapy. Really good psychotherapy is like physiotherapy for the nerves. It eases tensions and teaches us how to move in a more healthy way—at the neural level. Because the nerves of the brain are more complicatedcreatures than the muscles of the body, a trainer needs to have more creative exercises up his sleeve. Hypnotherapists often use thought journeys and guided imagery techniques. These aim to reduce the intensity of pain signals and alter the way the brain processes certain stimuli. Just like muscles, certain nerves can become stronger with increased use. The therapy does not involve hypnotism as seen in television shows. That would, in fact, be self-defeating, since this kind of therapy relies on the patient being in control at all times. Patients must make sure the hypnotherapist they choose is recognized by a reputable institution.

Hypnotherapy has been shown to be effective in treating patients with irritable bowel syndrome, reducing their reliance on medication—in some cases to zero. This is particularly true of children with this condition. For them, hypnotherapy has been shown to produce a 90-percent reduction in pain, compared with a 40-percent reduction produced by drugs. Some clinics offer specific hypnotherapy for abdominal complaints.

Patients with intestinal disease who also suffer from extreme anxiety or depressive disorders are often recommended antidepressants by their doctor. However, they are rarely told why. And there is a simple reason for that: no doctor or scientists knows. It was not until they noticed the mood- enhancing effects of these drugs that scientists began to explore the mechanisms behind this phenomenon. They still have not come up with a clear answer. For decades, it was thought to be due to an enhancing effect of the so-called happiness hormone serotonin. More recently, depression researchers have also begun investigating another possibility—that such drugs may increase the plasticity of the nerves.

Neuroplasticity is the nerves’ ability to change. It is nerve plasticity that makes puberty such a confusing time for an adolescent brain—so much is still being molded into shape. The possibilities are endless and nerves are constantly firing off messages in all directions in a pubescent brain. This process is not complete until we reach the age of about twenty- five. After that, nerves react according to well-rehearsed patterns. Patterns that have proved useful in the past are retained; others are rejected as failures. This explains the disappearance not only of the inexplicable fits of laughter and temper tantrums of the teenage years, but also of the posters plastering the bedroom walls. After this age, we find it more difficult to deal with sudden change, but the payback is a more stable, calmer disposition. This can also result in negative thought patterns taking root, such as *I am worthless* or *Everything I do goes wrong*. The nervous messages from a worried gut can also become embedded in a person’s mind. If it is the case that antidepressants increase neuroplasticity, theymay work by loosening up such negative thought patterns. This is most beneficial when accompanied by effective psychotherapy to help patients resist slipping back into old habits.

After all, 95 percent of the serotonin we produce is manufactured in the cells of our gut, where it has an enormous effect on enabling the nerves to stimulate muscle movement and acts as an important signaling molecule. If its effects on the gut can be changed, the messages sent from there to the brain would also be changed enormously.  

## The World of Microbes

Our gut microbiome can weigh up to 2 kilos and contains about 100 trillion bacteria. One-thirty-second of 1 gram of feces contains more bacteria than there are people on Earth. We also know that this community of microbes cracks open indigestible foodstuffs for us, supplies the gut with energy, manufactures vitamins, breaks down toxins and medications, and trains our immune system. Different bacteria manufacture different substances: acids, gases, fats. You could say bacteria are tiny factories. We know that gut bacteria are responsible for blood groups and that harmful bacteria cause diarrhea.

One person might have stronger nerves than another because she has a better stock of vitamin B-producing bacteria. Another person might be able to deal easily with bit of bread mold eaten by mistake. Yet another might have a tendency to gain weight because the *chubby* bacteria in his gut feed him a bit too willingly. Science is just beginning to understand that each of us is an entire ecosystem. Microbiome research is still young, complete with wobbly milk teeth and short pants.

Microbiome refers to our collection of microbes and their genes.

In general, it is accurate to say that the number of bacteria is smaller in the upper sections of the digestive tract, while a very, very large number reside in the lower parts, such as the large intestine and the rectum. Some bacteria prefer the small intestine; others live exclusively in the colon. There are great fans of the appendix, well-behaved homebodies that stick to the mucus membrane, and rather cheekier chaps that nestle up close to the cells of our gut.

Our gastrointestinal tract is home to more than a thousand different species of bacteria—plus minority populations of viruses and yeasts, as well as fungi and various other single-celled organisms.  

## The Immune System and Our Bacteria

We face potential death every day. We could get cancer, get eaten away by bacteria, or get infected with a deadly virus. And several times a day, our lives are saved. Strangely mutated cells are destroyed, fungal spores are eliminated, bacteria are peppered with holes, and viruses are sliced in two. This agreeable service is provided by our immune system, with its many little cells. Its workforce includes experts at spotting foreign bodies, contract killers, hatters, and mediators. They all work hand in hand, and together they are a pretty top team.

The vast majority of our immune system (about 80 percent) is located in the gut. And with good reason. This is where the main stage at the bacterial Woodstock is situated, and any immune system worth its salt must be there or be square. The bacteria are confined to a fenced-off area —the mucus membrane of the gut—preventing them from getting too dangerously close to the cells of the gut wall. The immune system can play with the cells without ever posing a danger to the body. This allows our defender cells to get acquainted with many previously unknown species.

If, sometime later and elsewhere in the body, an immune cell encounters a now-familiar bacterium, it can react to it much more quickly. The immune system has to be extremely careful in the gut, suppressing its defensive instincts and allowing the many bacteria there to live in peace. But, at the same time, it must also recognize dangerous elements in the crowd and weed them out. If we decided to say “Hi” to each of our gut bacteria individually, we might just manage it in around 3 million years. Our immune system not only says, “Hi,” it also says, **You’re okay**, or **I’d prefer to see you dead**.

## The Adult Gut Population

Sometimes we alter our gut flora, and sometimes it alters us. We are our flora’s weather and its seasons. Our flora can take care of us, or it can poison us.

Biologists love to put things in order—from the contents of their own desks to the entire contents of the world. They begin by sorting everything into two large drawers: one for living things and the other for non-living things. They then go on to divide everything in the first drawer into three categories: 
* eukaryotes
* archaea
* bacteria

Representatives of all three groups can be found in the gut. I am not promising too much when I say each of the three groups has its own kind of charm.

Eukaryotes are made up of the largest and most complex cells. They can be multicellular and grow to a pretty impressive size. A whale is a eukaryote. Humans are eukaryotes. Ants are too, incidentally, although they are much smaller than we are. Modern biologists divide eukaryotes into six subgroups: crawly amoeboid microbes, microbes with pseudopodia (foot-like protrusions that aren’t real feet), plant-like organisms, single-celled organisms with little mouth-like feeding grooves, algae, and opisthokonts.

For those unfamiliar with the term opisthokont (it comes from the Greek words for *rear* and *pole*), it describes the group that includes all animals—humans as well—and also fungi. So, the next time you meet an ant in the street you can give it a friendly wave as a fellow opisthokont. The most common eukaryotes found in the gut are yeasts, which are also opisthokonts. We are familiar with yeast as a rising agent for bread, but there are many other kinds.

Archaea are kind of in-betweeners. Not really eukaryotes, but not really bacteria, either. Their cells are small and complex. If this description seems a little vague, it may help if I say that the Archaea are pretty rad characters. They love the extreme things in life. Some are hyperthermophiles, which feel right at home in temperatures of more than 100 degrees Celsius and are often to be found hanging out near volcanoes. The acidophiles among the Archaea like to paddle around in highly concentrated acid. Barophiles (also called piezophiles) thrive under pressure and have specially adapted cell walls to allow them to live on the deep sea floor. Halophiles are at home in extremely salty water (they love the Dead Sea). The rare characters among the Archaea that can be cultured in the lab are the cryophiles, which love the cold. They like laboratory freezers that keep them at a cozy -80 degrees Celsius. There is one species of Archaea often found in our gut that thrives on the waste products of other gut bacteria and can glow.

Bacteria make up more than 90 percent of the population of our gut. Biologists divide bacteria into more than twenty phyla or lineages. Members of different phyla are sometimes about as similar as human beings are to excavates (single-cell microbes with feeding grooves)—that is to say, not very. Most of the inhabitants of our gut belong to one of five phyla: mainly Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, with a smattering of Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia. These phyla are further divided into increasingly specific categories, until we eventually reach the level of the bacteria family. Members of a given family are relatively similar to each other. They eat the same food, keep similar company, and have similar abilities. Individual family members have impressive names like :
* Bacteroides uniformis
* Lactobacillus acidophilus
* Helicobacter pylori

The bacteria kingdom is huge.

Whenever scientists search humans for a particular bacterium, they constantly come across new, previously unknown species. Or they discover known species in unexpected places. In 2011, a group of researchers in the United States decided to examine the flora of volunteers’ belly buttons, just for fun. One subject’s navel was found to contain bacteria that were previously known to live only in the seas off the coast of Japan—despite the fact that the volunteer had never even been to Asia. Globalization is not just your local corner shop turning into a McDonald’s —it affects even the contents of our navels. Every day, billions and billions of foreign microorganisms fly round the world without paying a single cent for their tickets.

Everyone has their own personal collection of bacteria. It could even be described as a unique bacterial fingerprint. If you were to take swabs from a dog and analyze the genes of its bacteria, the dog’s owner could be easily identified with reasonable certainty. The same is true of computer keyboards. Anything we come into regular contact with carries our microbial signature. Everyone has some outlandish items in their collection that almost no one else will share.

The microbial landscape in our gut is just as unique and individual. So, how are doctors supposed to know what is beneficial and what is harmful? Uniqueness like this presents researchers with a problem. If they are tryingto ascertain what influence our gut bacteria have on our health, it is no use finding out that Mr. Smith is carrying a strange Asian species and several other weird microbes in his gut. Scientists need to identify patterns to deduce facts from them.

So, since scientists are faced with more than a thousand different families of bacteria, they must decide whether they need to identify just rough lineages or whether they should look at every paid-up member of the Bacteroides bacteria family individually. E. coli and its evil twin EHEC are members of the same family, for example. The differences between them are infinitesimally small—but they are very tangible: E. coli is a harmless gut-dweller, while EHEC causes severe internal bleeding and diarrhea. It always makes sense to examine families or lineages when you want to know what damage individual bacteria can wreak.

### The Genes of Our Bacteria

Genes are possibilities. Genes are information. Genes can be dominant, forcing features on us, or they can just offer their abilities for us to use or not. But most of all, genes are plans. They are incapable of doing anything unless they are read and implemented. Implementation of some of these plans is obligatory—they decide whether we are a human being or a bacterium, for example. 

Our gut bacteria have 150 times more genes than a human being. This massive collection of genes is called a biome. 

The guts of obese people are often found to contain more bacterial genes involved in breaking down carbohydrates. Older people have fewer bacterial genes for dealing with stress. In Tokyo, gut bacteria can help digest seaweed, and in Toronto, they probably can’t. Our gut bacteria paint a rough portrait of who we are: young, chubby, or Asian, perhaps.

The genes of our gut bacteria also inform us about our body’s abilities. The pain-relief drug acetaminophen can be more toxic for some people than others: some gut bacteria produce a substance that influences the liver’s ability to detoxify the drug.

Similar caution should be exercised with general dietary tips. `Soy ability` to protect against prostate cancer, cardiovascular disease, or bone disorders, for example, has now been proven. More than 50 percent of Asians benefit from this effect. Among people of European heritage, the beneficial effect is found among only 25 to 30 percent of the population. This cannot simply be explained by human genetic differences. The difference is due to certain bacteria. They are found more commonly in the guts of Asians, where they are able to coax the health-promoting essence out of tofu and other soy products.

If you look at all the bacterial genes so far discovered, the small individual groups of genes responsible for breaking down painkillers or soy products fade into the background. The common features they share dominate the picture. Every microbe contains many genes involved in breaking down carbohydrates or proteins and in producing vitamins.

Researchers in Heidelberg, Germany (2011), were using cutting-edge technology to investigate the human gut biome. They expected to see the usual picture: a chaotic mixture of many different bacteria, including a host of unknown species. What they actually discovered came as asurprise. Despite the great diversity, there was order. One of three families was always dominant in the realm of bacteria. Suddenly, the whole mess of more than a thousand families looked much more organized.  

### The Three Gut Types

A person enterotype depends on the family of bacteria that dominates the microbe population of their gut. The choice is between families that bask in the glory of the names Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Ruminococcus. Researchers identified these enterotypes distributed among Asians, Americans, and Europeans, irrespective of age or gender. In the future, enterotyping may help doctors predict a whole range of characteristics, such as the body’s response to soy, nerve resilience, or susceptibility to certain diseases.  

## The Role of the Gut Flora

The idea that the bacteria in our gut might influence our overall metabolism, and therefore our weight, is only a couple of years old. The basic concept is that bacteria do not steal anything from us when they share our food in this way. Very few gut bacteria reside in the small intestine, where we break down our food for ourselves and absorb the nutrients from it. The highest concentration of bacteria is found where the digestive process is almost finished and all that remains is for the undigested remnants to be transported away. The farther you travel from the small intestine toward the final exit from the gut, the more bacteria you will find per square inch of gut membrane. It is our gut that makes sure this remains so. If the equilibrium is disturbed and large numbers of overconfident bacteria migrate to the small intestine, we have a case of what doctors call bacterial overgrowth. This relatively unexplored condition causes symptoms that can include severe bloating, abdominal pain, joint pain, and gastrointestinal infections, as well as nutrientdeficiencies and anemia.

Bacteria produce nutrients that are so tiny we can absorb them directly into the cells of our gut. Bacteria can also perform this service outside the gut. Yogurt is nothing other than milk that has been predigested by bacteria. Much of the sugar in the milk (lactose) has already been broken down and transformed into lactic acid (lactate) and smaller sugar molecules. That is why yogurt is both sweeter and sourer than milk. The newly formed acid has another effect on the milk. It causes the milk protein to curdle, giving the yogurt its characteristic thick consistency. Predigested milk (yogurt) saves our body some work—we just have to finish off what the bacteria started.

It is an especially good idea to employ those bacteria to predigest our food that manufacture healthy end products. Mindful yogurt manufacturers often use bacteria that produce more dextrorotatory (right-turning) than levorotatory (left-turning) lactic acids. Molecules of the two kinds of lactic acid are mirror images of each other. Feeding the human digestive system with levorotatory lactic acid molecules is like giving a left-handed pair of scissors to a right-handed person: they’re hard to handle. That is why it is a good idea to pick yogurt from the supermarket shelves that states on the container: **Contains mainly dextrorotatory [or right-turning] lactic acid**.

Almost none of what a wine taster will tell you is actually to be found in the bottle. The wine’s bouquet, for example, develops so late because bacteria need time to do their work. They sit in waiting at the back of the tongue, where the process of transforming what we eat or drink begins. 

The bacteria population of our mouth is only about one-ten-thousandth of the number that live in the gut, yet we still taste the results of their work.

In the industrialized world, about 90 percent of our nutrition comes from what we eat, and we are fed about 10 percent by our bacteria. So, after nine lunches, meal number ten is on the house, so to speak. Feeding adults is the main occupation of some of our bacteria. That does not mean that it makes no difference what we eat—far from it. And the kind of bacteria that are feeding us also makes a big difference. In other words, if we are concerned about our weight, we need to think about more than just the big, fat calories we consume and remember that our bacteria are at the dinner table with us.  

### Cholesterol and Gut Bacteria

Really valuable studies began about twenty years ago. For one experiment in 2011, 114 Canadians ate specially produced yogurt twice a day. The bacterium added to the yogurt was Lactobacillus reuteri—in a form particularly resistant to digestion. Within six weeks, their levels of bad LDL cholesterol sank by 8.91 percent. That’s about half the improvement attained by taking a mild anti-cholesterol drug—but without the side effects. Studies using other types of bacteria lowered cholesterol levels by as much as 11 to 30 percent.

But we need to take a step back and ask cautiously: does the body always want to get rid of its cholesterol? It produces between 75 and 90 percent of our cholesterol itself. And that takes a lot of work! One-sided media reporting has given cholesterol a bad name, making people believe it is only evil. That is quite wrong. Too much cholesterol is not such a good thing, but neither is too little. If it weren’t for cholesterol, we would have unstable cells and no sex hormones or vitamin D. Fat and cholesterol are not only an issue for Granny and her weakness for cream cakes or sausages. They are an issue for every one of us. Studies have shown a connection between too little cholesterol and memory problems, depression, and aggressive behavior.

Cholesterol is also the miraculous base material for building all sorts of structures. Too much of it is indeed harmful—it’s all about finding the right balance. Our bacteria would not be our bacteria if they didn’t have the ability to help us achieve that. Some bacteria produce more of a substance called propionate, which inhibits the production of cholesterol. Others produce more acetate, which promotes the production of cholesterol.

Bacteria help to feed us, make some foods more digestible, and produce their own substances. Some scientists now support the theory that our gut microbiota can be considered an organ. Just like the other organs in our body, this organ has an origin, develops along with us, is made up of a load of cells, and is in constantcontact with its fellow organs.  

### Cleaning

A team from Ghent in Belgium is currently trying out a brand-new method. The researchers are attempting to use bacteria to combat body odor. They disinfect volunteers armpits, spread them with odorless bacteria, and start the stopwatch. After a couple of minutes, the subjects are allowed to put their shirts back on and go home. The volunteers return repeatedly to the laboratory, where experts sniff their armpits. The initial results are quite promising—the odorless bacteria manage to banish their smelly colleagues in many of the subjects’ armpits.

Not far away, across the border in Germany, the same method is in use in the public toilets of the small town of Düren. A company is using a mixture of bacteria to clean the toilets. The odorless bacteria occupy the places normally colonized by the bugs that create that all-too-familiar public toilet smell. The idea of using bacteria to clean public conveniences is a brilliant one. Unfortunately, the company refuses to reveal the recipe for its cocktail of bacterial cleaners, so a scientific evaluation is impossible. However, the town of Düren seems to be faring very well with this experiment.  

### Antibiotics

Antibiotics are the weapons used by both sides in the war betweenfungi and bacteria.

Ever since researchers discovered all this, pharmaceutical companies have been intensively farming bacteria. Huge tanks with a capacity of up to 26,500 US gallons (100,000 liters) are used to grow so many bacteria that their numbers can hardly be expressed in any meaningful figures. They produce antibiotics, which we purify and press into little tablets. The product sells well, especially in the United States. When researchers were planning a study of the effect of antibiotics on the flora of the gut, they were able to find only two people in the entire San Francisco Bay Area who had not taken antibiotics in the previous two years. In Germany, one person in every four takes antibiotics once a year on average. The main reason for taking them is colds. This is like a knife in the heart of any microbiologist. Colds are often not even caused by bacteria, but by viruses! Antibiotics can work in three different ways: by peppering the bacteria with holes, by poisoning the bacteria, or by rendering the bacteria unable to reproduce. They have no effect on viruses at all.

So taking antibiotics to cure a cold is usually a complete waste of time.
