## Rules 

Generally valid for any meat :

**Fats** are **container** for lot of   

* vitamins   
* minerals  

And that is good... But all **bad things** are stored there as well like  

* hormones  
* antibiotics  
* heavy metals  

Therefore the best and **safest meet** is the **less fatty**.

## Grind the meat

Get for example **200gr pork** (Kotleta, doesnt deserve to grid Panenka) and **200gr beef** (doesn't deserve to grid Svichkova) and ask them to grind it...


Recipe :  

* 1 liter water
* 400gr meat grinded  
* 1 carrot (chopped)
* 1-2 piece of Celery
* one bulb of onion (chopped)
* 1 egg
* Greek yogurt

Mix meat, with a bit of **salt** and black **paper**. If you like put **rice** inside meatballs, makes them more **consistent**. Then create meatballs at the size of **cherry** tomatoes. 

When water is **boiled**, drop the chopped **onion**, **carrot** and **celery**. Continue with the **meatballs**, if you don't add **rice** from previous step, feel free to add rice or **pasta** together, in the water.

Boil it for **20 minutes**.

Before get pot out of fire, mix an **egg** with **2 spoons yogurt**  (add just a grain of salt, as salt help to mix better the egg), and **slowly slowly** add it while **slowly mixing** into the **soup**. In this way you will **avoid** big **pieces** of egg in the soup. It will become **white** and more **smooth**.

Nothing goes out... You just added!!

When is on fire, leave it 10m to consolidate.

When serving, add olive oil per plate. Optionally you can add **lemon** per plate, don't add lemon in the **pot** because more **acid** can help some **bacteria** to develop.

## Tenderloin steak

Boiled **potatoes**, **smashed**, with a bit of **butter** and **lemon** and black **paper** and **olive oil**  and milk if you like. 

With tenderloin steak **fried** in **very hot olive oil** (*).. You keep it **2 minutes** from each **side**. And the dish is done.

So you **heat** the oil.... But really **well**... Almost to the point of **burn**. When the olive **oil** is very **hot** put the **meat** or **vegetable** into it... It is heating just the **surface** and create a **seal**...

----------  


Leaving meat to **thaw** at **room** temperature or on the kitchen counter can allow bacteria to **grow** and increase the risk of foodborne illness. However, thawing meat in the **refrigerator** overnight (8-12 hours) is a **safe** and effective way to thaw meat without allowing it to reach temperatures that are conducive to bacterial growth.  

When you thaw meat in the refrigerator, the meat stays at a safe temperature (below 4.4c) and **remains** cold enough to **prevent** the growth of harmful bacteria. It may take longer than other thawing methods, but it is the **safest way** to thaw meat.  

If you don't have **time** to thaw meat in the refrigerator, you can also use the cold water method or the microwave method to thaw meat more quickly. However, it's important to follow safe food handling practices when using these methods to avoid the risk of foodborne illness.  

To thaw meat using the cold water method, place the meat in a leak-proof plastic bag and submerge it in cold water, changing the water every 30 minutes until the meat is thawed. To thaw meat in the microwave, use the defrost setting and follow the microwave directions.
