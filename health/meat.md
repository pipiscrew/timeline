## Rules 

Generally valid for any meat :

**Fats** are **container** for lot of   

* vitamins   
* minerals  

And that is good... But all **bad things** are stored there as well like  

* hormones  
* antibiotics  
* heavy metals  

Therefore the best and **safest meet** is the **less fatty**.

> Fats exist into meat and are not visible by naked eye  (you do not have to see the fat, to be there)  

Meat **500gr / day** for **5 days / week** is acceptable

----------

## Grind the meat

Get for example **200gr pork** (Kotleta, doesnt deserve to grid Panenka) and **200gr beef** (doesn't deserve to grid Svichkova) and ask them to grind it...


Recipe :  

* 1 liter water
* 400gr meat grinded  
* 1 carrot (chopped)
* 1-2 piece of Celery
* one bulb of onion (chopped)
* 1 egg
* Greek yogurt

Mix meat, with a bit of **salt** and black **paper**. If you like put **rice** inside meatballs, makes them more **consistent**. Then create meatballs at the size of **cherry** tomatoes. 

When water is **boiled**, drop the chopped **onion**, **carrot** and **celery**. Continue with the **meatballs**, if you don't add **rice** from previous step, feel free to add rice or **pasta** together, in the water.

Boil it for **20 minutes**.

Before get pot out of fire, mix an **egg** with **2 spoons yogurt**  (add just a grain of salt, as salt help to mix better the egg), and **slowly slowly** add it while **slowly mixing** into the **soup**. In this way you will **avoid** big **pieces** of egg in the soup. It will become **white** and more **smooth**.

Nothing goes out... You just added!!

When is on fire, leave it 10m to consolidate.

When serving, add olive oil per plate. Optionally you can add **lemon** per plate, don't add lemon in the **pot** because more **acid** can help some **bacteria** to develop.


----------

## Tenderloin steak

Boiled **potatoes**, **smashed**, with a bit of **butter** and **lemon** and black **paper** and **olive oil**  and milk if you like. 

With tenderloin steak **fried** in **very hot olive oil** (*).. You keep it **2 minutes** from each **side**. And the dish is done.

So you **heat** the oil.... But really **well**... Almost to the point of **burn**. When the olive **oil** is very **hot** put the **meat** or **vegetable** into it... It is heating just the **surface** and create a **seal**...

The **meat** will release **juice** and will start boiling again. So you put the meat in keep it just 2 minutes.
It get **sealed** outside and **bloody juicy** inside.


Food have to tasty as well.

(*) Compared to other oils as sunflower, rapeseed, palm, etc... **Olive oil** is least harmful...
