**Ions** = particles in the atmosphere that carry electricity. Are invisible particles, either molecules or atoms, which bear an electric charge. Atoms, for instance, consist of an atomic nucleus that contains neutral neutrons and **positively charged** protons, as well as orbiting electrons that are **negatively charged**. When an atom is in a neutral condition, the number of protons (+) and electrons (-) is equal. When the number of protons and electrons is not the same, the particle becomes an ion that is either positively or negatively charged. Positive ions are harmful to the human body, while negative ions are beneficial.

Negative ions are in the air that we breathe as well as in our bodies. They **neutralize** free radicals, revitalize cell metabolism and enhance immune function. In addition, they **purify** the blood and **balance** the autonomic nervous system, promoting **deep sleep** and healthy digestion. Negative ions also **protect** the body and mind from the harmful effects of environmental **stressors** such as electromagnetic fields. **Negative ions** are **naturally generated by evaporating water**.

**Earth surface** has a negative charge, you can absorb **negative ions** through your feet by walking on the ground barefoot.

**Electrons** are **highly sensitive to shock**, impact, electric current and atmospheric change. **Air pressure** or heat, for instance, can cause electrons to escape from atoms and dissipate, increasing the number of positive ions in the air.

In our daily lives, we can directly experience the electricity of ions in the air in the form of static electricity - especially in winter, when the **air is dry**. Static is caused by a **high ratio of positive** to negative ions because of a **lack** of moisture in the air.


## positive ions (cations)  

Are **small molecules** that have gained a positive charge. Most forms of pollution  

* toxic chemicals
* pet dander
* pollen
* mold

and other harmful chemicals in the air **carry a positive** electrical charge, making them positive ions.

Having (inhale) high levels of positive ions in the environment can lead to a **host of ailments**. This is because we are surrounded by positive ions from **electromagnetic fields** generated by computers, cell phones, and other electronic devices which can **impair brain** function and **suppress** the immune system causing symptoms such as:

* anxiety
* breathing difficulty
* fatigue
* headaches
* irritability
* lack of energy
* poor concentration
* nausea
* vertigo

## negative ions (anions)  

Are the **opposite** of positive ions and they have the opposite effect on your **health**, mood, and energy levels.

We **inhale** negative ions in environments such as

* ocean
* mountains
* forests
* waterfalls

Once they reach our **bloodstream**, negative ions produce biochemical reactions that **increase** levels of the mood chemical serotonin, helping to alleviate depression, relieve stress, and <span style="color:red">boost energy</span>.

They are **statically attracted** to airborne **particles** like dust, mold spores, pet dander, and other floating pollutants and potential allergens.. By **attaching** to these pollutants and allergens they give them a negative charge and, rather than drifting in the **air**, they are grounded and **fall** to the floor or nearest surface.

## the ratio of negative to positive ions is crucial to health

The **ratio** of negative to positive ions is **crucial**, because negative ions are able to neutralize the **harmful** effects of positive ions. At the beginning of the 20th century, the ratio in the **atmosphere was 1.2 negative ions** for every positive ion. However, in recent years, the ratio has **reversed** and now there are **1.2 positive** ions for every negative ion. This is due to environmental hazards such as air and water pollution, electromagnetic fields, and other factors.

Positive and negative ions also exist in our bodies, and the ratio of ions in the air we breathe influences the ratio in our **bodies**. Ions enter the body through the lungs (inhalation) as well as through the skin. Then they travel through the **blood** and lymphatic systems to **cells** throughout the body.

Ions were first linked to human health by a **Japanese** medical study in **1910**, which showed that patients with **arthritis** experienced **greater pain** when weather fluctuations **elevated** the percentage of **positive** ions in the atmosphere.

**Cold fronts** and low pressure systems **increase** the percentage of **positive** ions in the atmosphere. Doctors in Japan report that under such conditions, the symptoms of their asthma and arthritis patients are **aggravated**, and the number of **strokes** increases.

When blood or urine samples from individuals reporting such symptoms are analyzed, extremely high levels of the stress hormone serotonin are detected. This hormone is known to be potentially harmful to the body at high levels, and it is thought that positive ions may work to increase serum serotonin. (**Negative** ions, on the other hand, **cause** the body to convert **excess** serotonin into a **harmless** compound).

**Positive ions turn into free radicals** in the body, oxidizing cells throughout the entire system. They **damage** healthy **cells** and increase the **acidity** of the blood. When cells are oxidized, lactic acid levels rise drastically, resulting in a variety of maladies, including cancer. The balance of the endocrine, immune, and autonomic nervous systems is thrown off, and blood and lymph circulation declines. As a result, aging processes accelerate, and premature aging occurs.

**Negative ions** work to **prevent** oxidation by neutralizing the free radicals in our cells. As a result, cells are **revitalized**, and immunity and **resistance** are strengthened. Negative ions also work to balance the autonomic nervous system and improve gastrointestinal function. They can relax the mind and body, **promote** deep sleep, increase metabolism, stabilize appetite and blood pressure, enhance recovery from physical exhaustion, and help one feel refreshed and invigorated. Negative ions are essential to overall health.

In [1975](https://books.google.cz/books?id=sqtdDwAAQBAJ&lpg=PT76&ots=dx33svdh3y&dq=%22Nanzandoh%20Medical%20Clinic%22%201975&pg=PT76#v=onepage&q=%22Nanzandoh%20Medical%20Clinic%22%201975&f=false), Nanzandoh Medical Clinic in **Japan** published some astonishing results from their research on **negative ion therapy**, finding it effective in the treatment of 

* high blood pressure
* rheumatoid arthritis
* arthritis
* tinnitus (ringing of the ears)

as well as for various disorders of the nervous, respiratory, and digestive systems, thyroid gland, and skin. It was also found to **speed recovery** from illness and slow aging processes.

An **air ioniser** (or negative ion generator or Chizhevsky's chandelier) is a device that uses **high voltage** to ionise (electrically **charge**) air molecules. Air ionisers **are used** in air purifiers to remove particles from air. Airborne particles become **charged** as they attract charged ions from the ioniser by electrostatic attraction. 

Another type of air ioniser is the **electrostatic discharge** (ESD) ioniser (balanced ion generator) used to neutralise static charge.

Even the best ionisers will also **produce** a small amount of **ozone**. At high concentrations ozone can be toxic to air-borne bacteria, and may destroy or kill these sometimes infectious organisms. Ozone is a **highly toxic** and extremely reactive gas. A higher daily average than 0.1 ppm (**100 ppb**, 0.2 mg/m3) is not recommended and can damage the lungs and olfactory bulb cells directly. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_ioniser)

[Studies](http://www.arb.ca.gov/research/indoor/esp_report.pdf) have found that ionizing air cleaners typically emit between **0.5 and 0.4 mg** of ozone per hour. The FDA ozone emission limit is **50ppb**, and most air cleaners average an emission rate between **20 and 30 ppb**, so they're within the safe level as defined by the FDA. There is a caveat, however. Ozone interacts with home appliances, thus leading to higher ozone levels. [source](https://www.greenbuildermedia.com/iaq/blog/do-ionizing-air-cleaners-work)

At the **base** of **Niagara Falls**, the negative ion count can be measured up to **30,000 to 100,000** negative ions per cubic centimeter. In office buildings and urban environments, the negative ion count can be anywhere from zero to only a few hundred per cubic centimeter. [source](https://archive.naplesnews.com/community/on-the-trail-wind-waves-and-water-ep-406096312-333227891.html/)

The WHO recommends not less than **1,500** negative ions per cm3, and ideally at least 1,800 per cc.  Urban air typically measures far below the recommended levels, with Los Angeles, for example, measuring in the **neighborhood of 80 negative ions** per cm3.

## air purifiers

The larger the **CADR number** listed on the air purifier, the more particulate matter the filter will remove from the air. Typically, the larger the room, the larger the CADR number you want.  There is **no** industry standard for the CADR number associated with room size. Many times, the manufacturer will list the recommended room size on the packaging. Most air cleaner packaging will tell you the largest size area or room it should be used in. Air cleaners often **achieve** a high CADR by **using** a high-efficiency particulate air (**HEPA**) filter. [source](https://reviewsofairpurifiers.com/how-to-choose-an-air-purifier/)  

EPA in their [Guide to Air Cleaners in the Home (2018)](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2018-07/documents/guide_to_air_cleaners_in_the_home_2nd_edition.pdf), makes recommendations about CADR and room size (calculated based on an 2.4m ceiling).  

| Room area (m2)     | 9   | 18  | 27  | 37  | 46  | 55  |
|--------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Minimum CADR (cfm) | 65  | 130 | 195 | 260 | 325 | 390 |
| Minimum CADR (m3h) | 110 | 220 | 331 | 441 | 552 | 662 |

> If an air purifier suggest you should have an open window, it may be because it generates ozone.
If there is a metallic smell lingering in the room with a purifier on, that might be ozone. 

Air purifier with window open ?  
> It's a waste - similar to keep your windows wide open while your airconditioner or heating system is running. Or keeping your fridge door wide open. Basically the constant draft of air will bring the 'unpurified' air back into your room at a faster rate then the unit purifying the air. Ideally the room should be closed so that it can work effectively.
> Of course the air should be recycled 1-2 times / day, when cooking always open the window!!


How long can you run an air purifier before [changing](https://qr.ae/pG1VIJ) the filter?  
The boring answer is “it depends on your filter,” but here are three much more useful insights I’ve learned from actually testing HEPA lifespan:  

* The color of the filter is an unreliable indicator of when to change the filter.
* HEPAs actually get better at capturing particles as they age.
* Air speed is the only reliable way to test if your HEPA needs to be changed.

So assumming that the air purifier company writes change the filter every 6 months  
-Is that six months in Sweden or China?

HEPAs get **black really quick**, yet they remain effective for long after. In other words, **color** is essentially **useless** for detecting when a HEPA needs to be **replaced**. The best method is to test **air flow**.  

In the following conditions, filter may be replaced:

* If the output air **pressure** is dropped by 50% from the initial days of usage
* If the output air is **smelling** of gases, mold etc
* If the air purifier is **not used** for over 2 months at a stretch

Here are some tips to ensure [efficiency](https://qr.ae/pG1VTB) and higher filter life  

* **Never Vacuum** the HEPA
* Expose the HEPA to bright **sunlight** for 3 to 4 hours at least **once** in a month
* Clean the **Filter cavity** every 15 days

Most air filters will have a light that goes on when the air flow is partially blocked. That’s when you change it.

#### meaning & prioritized order by potential health risks :
* **PM2.5**: Particulate Matter 2.5 micrometers or smaller (PM2.5) remains at the highest priority due to its ability to penetrate deep into the lungs and its significant health implications.
* **AQI**: The Air Quality Index (AQI) provides an overall assessment of air quality, considering multiple pollutants. It helps individuals understand the current air quality conditions and make informed decisions.
* **CO2**: Carbon dioxide (CO2) monitoring is important for assessing indoor air quality and ventilation effectiveness. Elevated CO2 levels may indicate inadequate ventilation, potentially leading to discomfort and reduced cognitive function.
* **TVOC**: Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOC) measurement is crucial for assessing the collective concentration of various VOCs. Elevated TVOC levels can indicate poor indoor air quality and potential health risks.
* **PM10**: Particulate Matter 10 micrometers or smaller (PM10) represents larger particles and can contribute to respiratory and cardiovascular issues. While PM2.5 is of greater concern, monitoring PM10 levels provides additional information about overall particulate pollution.
* **HCHO**: Formaldehyde (HCHO) monitoring is still important, but it has a relatively lower priority compared to the other measurements listed. Formaldehyde emissions are not as widespread as particulate matter or VOCs, although it can have health implications.

#### filters explained
* **HEPA** capture and trap PM2.5 and PM10.
* **Activated Carbon** adsorbing and trapping odors, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and some harmful gases like formaldehyde, ammonia, and certain chemicals.

#### pm explained
When using an air meter to measure PM (Particulate Matter) in **microns**.

The most commonly used classification for PM is based on the aerodynamic diameter of the **particles**. The micrometer (µm) is the unit of measurement used for particle **size**. Common PM size categories:

* **PM10**: Particles with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 micrometers or smaller. These particles include dust, pollen, mold spores, and larger particles that are visible to the **naked eye**. Particulates including :
  * **Dust and Soil**: Wind erosion of dust and soil, particularly in arid or dry regions, can generate PM10 particles. Construction sites, unpaved roads, and agricultural activities are common sources.
  * **Pollen and Biological Particles**: Pollen grains from trees, grasses, and other plants, as well as spores from molds and fungi, can contribute to PM10 levels, especially during pollen seasons.
  * **Industrial and Construction Activities**: Dust and particulate emissions from industrial processes, construction sites, mining operations, and material handling can release PM10 particles.
  * **Road Dust**: Traffic movement on unpaved roads or poorly maintained paved roads can generate dust, contributing to PM10 levels in the vicinity.
  **Crushing and Grinding Operations**: Activities such as crushing rocks, grinding operations, or crushing and processing of minerals can generate PM10 particulates.
* **PM2.5**: Particles with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller. This category includes fine particles such as combustion particles, organic compounds, and smaller dust particles. PM2.5 is often associated with haze and can penetrate deep into the respiratory system. Particulates including :
  * **Combustion Processes**: PM2.5 particles can be emitted from combustion processes, including the burning of fossil fuels in vehicles, power plants, and industrial facilities.
  * **Vehicle Emissions**: Exhaust emissions from cars, trucks, and other motor vehicles are significant sources of PM2.5 particles, especially from diesel engines.
  * **Industrial Emissions**: Industrial activities such as manufacturing, construction, and mining can release PM2.5 particles into the air, especially if they involve processes that generate dust, smoke, or fumes.
  * **Residential Sources**: Activities like cooking, burning wood or biomass fuels for heating or cooking, and tobacco smoke can contribute to PM2.5 emissions indoors and outdoors.
  * **Wildfires**: Smoke from wildfires is a major source of PM2.5 particles, and it can travel long distances, affecting air quality in surrounding regions.

The more [disturbance](http://www.photographers-resource.co.uk/locations/nature/Waterfalls/Waterfall_health.htm) there is in the water the more you find **produced**, so while a garden pond fountain or stream may produce some, the more impressive the waterfall is, the more likely it is that you will feel the affect. Some people are able to feel this affect directly while it affects everyone who is nearby although they may not be able to feel it directly. In some European countries, some institutions like hospitals are required to ionize their air.

### air pollution is worse than you think
Traditionally, we thought that chemicals in the environment caused cancer by **mutating** DNA. It turns out the air pollution doesn’t mutate DNA. Instead, it creates an **inflammatory** response in a white cell called a **macrophage**. This cell releases an inflammatory **mediator** that can turn certain cells (those with a particular cancer-causing mutation) in the breathing apparatus of the lung into a cancer stem cell. In other words, the cancer-causing mutation and the air pollution work together in the right cell at the wrong time to initiate a cancer.

What we do know is that the **macrophage** takes up air pollutants. These particular particles are so **large** that they can't be **digested** by the cell. Instead, they **remain** in the cell until it **dies**. Because of this, throughout its life, the cell releases a sort of **SOS** signal—inflammatory **mediators** that communicate with **other** cells. This causes **chronic** long-term inflammation, which we speculate may be the central **cause** for the underlying pathologies associated with pollution, leading to **damage** for example, to the pancreas or type-two diabetes, or damage to blood vessels, which results in strokes and heart attacks.

There’s also an increasing move toward **electric cars**. That in itself won't eliminate the problem, however, because the air pollution doesn't just come from diesel and petrol exhausts. It also comes from car **tires** and **brake** dust. For instance, the levels of PM 2.5 particulates on the London Underground, which runs on electric trains, are particularly **high**. Also, in the winter, **wood** burners contribute to much **higher** levels of PM 2.5 particulates.

It’s estimated that over **90 percent** of the world population lives in areas where the concentrations of PM 2.5 air pollutants are **higher** than the WHO recommended level of 5 micrograms per meter cubed.

## humidifiers vs dehumidifiers

**Static electricity**, which builds up inside your home when the rooms are **dry**, actually attracts dust and makes it cling stubbornly to surfaces. Install a humidifier. [source](https://www.bobvila.com/articles/how-to-get-rid-of-dust#install-a-humidifier)  

`Humidifiers` add moisture to the air when it is too dry. Humidifiers in the wintertime to combat the dryness of winter air.  

| type    | temperature | humidity |
| ------- | ----------- | -------- |
| good    | 15 - 18,9°C | 30 - 39% |
| ideal   | 19 - 25°C   | 40 - 60% |
| good    | 25,1 - 30°C | 61 - 70% |
| neutral | < 15°C      | < 30%    |
| neutral | \> 30°C     | \> 70%   |

`Dehumidifier` take moisture out of the air when it is too humid. Dehumidifiers are used during the spring and summer.  

**Increasing moisture** it means increasing the amount of **water vapor** present in the air compared to the maximum amount the air can **hold** at a specific **temperature**.  

**Maintaining** an appropriate level of moisture is important for comfort and **health**. Dry air, which has low moisture content, can cause :  

* **Dry skin and irritation**: Low humidity can lead to dry, itchy skin, chapped lips, and dry nasal passages.
* **Respiratory problems**: Dry air can irritate the respiratory system and exacerbate conditions like allergies, asthma, and sinus congestion.
* **Increased susceptibility to infections**: Dry air may contribute to a higher risk of respiratory infections and make individuals more susceptible to colds, flu, and other respiratory illnesses.
* **Static electricity**: Low humidity can lead to static electricity buildup, resulting in annoying shocks and clinging clothes.  

**Moisture** (aka humidity) levels above 70% are considered high, high levels of moisture may facilitate the **growth** of biological organisms in the environment.  

To determine the **humidity level** in your home pick up a **hygrometer** is cheap, you can find it at a home improvement store. Below 50% use humidifier above 50% use dehumidifier. [source](https://burkholders-hvac.com/humidifiers-vs-dehumidifiers/)

**Dust** is a problem for multiple reasons: Tiny particles of skin, dirt, pollen, and dander can coat the surfaces of your furniture and walls, and as gross as it sounds they can also fill your **lungs**, which is why dust is often the underlying cause of **allergies**.

Q: Can use an air purifier and humidifier together at the same time?  
A: When used together, can complement each other functions. The **air purifier** helps remove pollutants from the air, including those that may be present in the **humidifier** water reservoir or introduced during the humidification process. This ensures that the air released by the **humidifier** is cleaner and healthier. Additionally, the **humidifier** helps maintain optimal humidity levels, which can enhance the effectiveness of the air purifier in capturing airborne particles.  

It is possible that the air quality **sensor** in the **air purifier** detected an increase in humidity levels or the release of particles (such as mineral dust or allergens) due to the operation of the **humidifier**. As a result, the air **purifier** automatically starts working to filter out any **impurities** that may have been introduced into the air during **humidification**. By using both an air purifier and an air humidifier together, you can **achieve** cleaner and more comfortable air in your environment.
