**Ions** = particles in the atmosphere that carry electricity. Are invisible particles, either molecules or atoms, which bear an electric charge. Atoms, for instance, consist of an atomic nucleus that contains neutral neutrons and **positively charged** protons, as well as orbiting electrons that are **negatively charged**. When an atom is in a neutral condition, the number of protons (+) and electrons (-) is equal. When the number of protons and electrons is not the same, the particle becomes an ion that is either positively or negatively charged. Positive ions are harmful to the human body, while negative ions are beneficial.

Negative ions are in the air that we breathe as well as in our bodies. They **neutralize** free radicals, revitalize cell metabolism and enhance immune function. In addition, they **purify** the blood and **balance** the autonomic nervous system, promoting **deep sleep** and healthy digestion. Negative ions also **protect** the body and mind from the harmful effects of environmental **stressors** such as electromagnetic fields. **Negative ions** are **naturally generated by evaporating water**.

**Earth surface** has a negative charge, you can absorb **negative ions** through your feet by walking on the ground barefoot.

**Electrons** are **highly sensitive to shock**, impact, electric current and atmospheric change. **Air pressure** or heat, for instance, can cause electrons to escape from atoms and dissipate, increasing the number of positive ions in the air.

In our daily lives, we can directly experience the electricity of ions in the air in the form of static electricity - especially in winter, when the **air is dry**. Static is caused by a **high ratio of positive** to negative ions because of a **lack** of moisture in the air.


## positive ions (cations)  

Are **small molecules** that have gained a positive charge. Most forms of pollution  

* toxic chemicals
* pet dander
* pollen
* mold

and other harmful chemicals in the air **carry a positive** electrical charge, making them positive ions.

Having (inhale) high levels of positive ions in the environment can lead to a **host of ailments**. This is because we are surrounded by positive ions from **electromagnetic fields** generated by computers, cell phones, and other electronic devices which can **impair brain** function and **suppress** the immune system causing symptoms such as:

* anxiety
* breathing difficulty
* fatigue
* headaches
* irritability
* lack of energy
* poor concentration
* nausea
* vertigo

## negative ions (anions)  

Are the **opposite** of positive ions and they have the opposite effect on your **health**, mood, and energy levels.

We **inhale** negative ions in environments such as

* ocean
* mountains
* forests
* waterfalls

Once they reach our **bloodstream**, negative ions produce biochemical reactions that **increase** levels of the mood chemical serotonin, helping to alleviate depression, relieve stress, and <span style="color:red">boost energy</span>.

They are **statically attracted** to airborne **particles** like dust, mold spores, pet dander, and other floating pollutants and potential allergens.. By **attaching** to these pollutants and allergens they give them a negative charge and, rather than drifting in the **air**, they are grounded and **fall** to the floor or nearest surface.  

## how to indoor

* Air purifier supporting negative ions.
* Negative ion generators  
	* US [IonPacific](https://ionbox.net/) products ([amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=IonPacific)) - produces 20m negative ions / second, valid for 46m2 apartment (otherwise take more than 1) - doesn't emit any ozone.

* Surround yourself with plants. They clean the air by taking in **carbon dioxide** and breathing out fresh **oxygen** and **many negative ions**. Some plants release **higher** levels of negative ions than others (best choices are chrysanthemum, coconut palm, gerbera, and spider plant). Chlorophyll plants and very sharp leaves of conifers emit negative [ions](https://www.teqoya.com/ionisation-negative-ions/).

These are simple **conductive** systems in the form of sheets, mats, wrist or ankle bands, adhesive patches that can be used inside the home or office, and footwear. These applications are connected to the Earth via a cord inserted into a grounded wall outlet..... [read more](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4378297/)
* Take a [shower](https://www.marksdailyapple.com/negative-ions-health/). The closest thing many of us get to moving water is our regular showers. And that’s not so bad. Moving water is moving water, and showers do a good job of producing negative ions in their own right.

## the ratio of negative to positive ions is crucial to health

The **ratio** of negative to positive ions is **crucial**, because negative ions are able to neutralize the **harmful** effects of positive ions. At the beginning of the 20th century, the ratio in the **atmosphere was 1.2 negative ions** for every positive ion. However, in recent years, the ratio has **reversed** and now there are **1.2 positive** ions for every negative ion. This is due to environmental hazards such as air and water pollution, electromagnetic fields, and other factors.

Positive and negative ions also exist in our bodies, and the ratio of ions in the air we breathe influences the ratio in our **bodies**. Ions enter the body through the lungs (inhalation) as well as through the skin. Then they travel through the **blood** and lymphatic systems to **cells** throughout the body.

Ions were first linked to human health by a **Japanese** medical study in **1910**, which showed that patients with **arthritis** experienced **greater pain** when weather fluctuations **elevated** the percentage of **positive** ions in the atmosphere.

**Cold fronts** and low pressure systems **increase** the percentage of **positive** ions in the atmosphere. Doctors in Japan report that under such conditions, the symptoms of their asthma and arthritis patients are **aggravated**, and the number of **strokes** increases.

When blood or urine samples from individuals reporting such symptoms are analyzed, extremely high levels of the stress hormone serotonin are detected. This hormone is known to be potentially harmful to the body at high levels, and it is thought that positive ions may work to increase serum serotonin. (**Negative** ions, on the other hand, **cause** the body to convert **excess** serotonin into a **harmless** compound).

**Positive ions turn into free radicals** in the body, oxidizing cells throughout the entire system. They **damage** healthy **cells** and increase the **acidity** of the blood. When cells are oxidized, lactic acid levels rise drastically, resulting in a variety of maladies, including cancer. The balance of the endocrine, immune, and autonomic nervous systems is thrown off, and blood and lymph circulation declines. As a result, aging processes accelerate, and premature aging occurs.

**Negative ions** work to **prevent** oxidation by neutralizing the free radicals in our cells. As a result, cells are **revitalized**, and immunity and **resistance** are strengthened. Negative ions also work to balance the autonomic nervous system and improve gastrointestinal function. They can relax the mind and body, **promote** deep sleep, increase metabolism, stabilize appetite and blood pressure, enhance recovery from physical exhaustion, and help one feel refreshed and invigorated. Negative ions are essential to overall health.

In [1975](https://books.google.cz/books?id=sqtdDwAAQBAJ&lpg=PT76&ots=dx33svdh3y&dq=%22Nanzandoh%20Medical%20Clinic%22%201975&pg=PT76#v=onepage&q=%22Nanzandoh%20Medical%20Clinic%22%201975&f=false), Nanzandoh Medical Clinic in **Japan** published some astonishing results from their research on **negative ion therapy**, finding it effective in the treatment of 

* high blood pressure
* rheumatoid arthritis
* arthritis
* tinnitus (ringing of the ears)

as well as for various disorders of the nervous, respiratory, and digestive systems, thyroid gland, and skin. It was also found to **speed recovery** from illness and slow aging processes.

An **air ioniser** (or negative ion generator or Chizhevsky's chandelier) is a device that uses **high voltage** to ionise (electrically **charge**) air molecules. Air ionisers **are used** in air purifiers to remove particles from air. Airborne particles become **charged** as they attract charged ions from the ioniser by electrostatic attraction. 

Another type of air ioniser is the **electrostatic discharge** (ESD) ioniser (balanced ion generator) used to neutralise static charge.

Even the best ionisers will also **produce** a small amount of **ozone**. At high concentrations ozone can be toxic to air-borne bacteria, and may destroy or kill these sometimes infectious organisms. Ozone is a **highly toxic** and extremely reactive gas. A higher daily average than 0.1 ppm (**100 ppb**, 0.2 mg/m3) is not recommended and can damage the lungs and olfactory bulb cells directly. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_ioniser)

[Studies](http://www.arb.ca.gov/research/indoor/esp_report.pdf) have found that ionizing air cleaners typically emit between **0.5 and 0.4 mg** of ozone per hour. The FDA ozone emission limit is **50ppb**, and most air cleaners average an emission rate between **20 and 30 ppb**, so they're within the safe level as defined by the FDA. There is a caveat, however. Ozone interacts with home appliances, thus leading to higher ozone levels. [source](https://www.greenbuildermedia.com/iaq/blog/do-ionizing-air-cleaners-work)

At the **base** of **Niagara Falls**, the negative ion count can be measured up to **30,000 to 100,000** negative ions per cubic centimeter. In office buildings and urban environments, the negative ion count can be anywhere from zero to only a few hundred per cubic centimeter. [source](https://archive.naplesnews.com/community/on-the-trail-wind-waves-and-water-ep-406096312-333227891.html/)

The WHO recommends not less than **1,500** negative ions per cm3, and ideally at least 1,800 per cc.  Urban air typically measures far below the recommended levels, with Los Angeles, for example, measuring in the **neighborhood of 80 negative ions** per cm3.

## air purifiers

The larger the **CADR number** listed on the air purifier, the more particulate matter the filter will remove from the air. Typically, the larger the room, the larger the CADR number you want.  There is **no** industry standard for the CADR number associated with room size. Many times, the manufacturer will list the recommended room size on the packaging. Most air cleaner packaging will tell you the largest size area or room it should be used in. Air cleaners often **achieve** a high CADR by **using** a high-efficiency particulate air (**HEPA**) filter. [source](https://reviewsofairpurifiers.com/how-to-choose-an-air-purifier/)  

EPA in their [Guide to Air Cleaners in the Home (2018)](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2018-07/documents/guide_to_air_cleaners_in_the_home_2nd_edition.pdf), makes recommendations about CADR and room size (calculated based on an 2.4m ceiling).  

| Room area (m2)     | 9   | 18  | 27  | 37  | 46  | 55  |
|--------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Minimum CADR (cfm) | 65  | 130 | 195 | 260 | 325 | 390 |
| Minimum CADR (m3h) | 110 | 220 | 331 | 441 | 552 | 662 |

> If an air purifier suggest you should have an open window, it may be because it generates ozone.
If there is a metallic smell lingering in the room with a purifier on, that might be ozone. 

Air purifier with window open ?  
> It's a waste - similar to keep your windows wide open while your airconditioner or heating system is running. Or keeping your fridge door wide open. Basically the constant draft of air will bring the 'unpurified' air back into your room at a faster rate then the unit purifying the air. Ideally the room should be closed so that it can work effectively.
> Of course the air should be recycled 1-2 times / day, when cooking always open the window!!


How long can you run an air purifier before [changing](https://qr.ae/pG1VIJ) the filter?  
The boring answer is “it depends on your filter,” but here are three much more useful insights I’ve learned from actually testing HEPA lifespan:  

* The color of the filter is an unreliable indicator of when to change the filter.
* HEPAs actually get better at capturing particles as they age.
* Air speed is the only reliable way to test if your HEPA needs to be changed.

So assumming that the air purifier company writes change the filter every 6 months  
-Is that six months in Sweden or China?

HEPAs get **black really quick**, yet they remain effective for long after.In other words, **color** is essentially **useless** for detecting when a HEPA needs to be **replaced**. The best method is to test **air flow**.

In the following conditions, filter may be replaced:

* If the output air **pressure** is dropped by 50% from the initial days of usage
* If the output air is **smelling** of gases, mold etc
* If the air purifier is **not used** for over 2 months at a stretch

Here are some tips to ensure [efficiency](https://qr.ae/pG1VTB) and higher filter life  

* **Never Vacuum** the HEPA
* Expose the HEPA to bright **sunlight** for 3 to 4 hours at least **once** in a month
* Clean the **Filter cavity** every 15 days

Most air filters will have a light that goes on when the air flow is partially blocked. That’s when you change it.

Some people are able to feel this affect directly while it affects everyone who is nearby although they may not be able to feel it directly. In some European countries, some institutions like hospitals are required to ionize their air.
