**Ions** = particles in the atmosphere that carry electricity. Are invisible particles, either molecules or atoms, which bear an electric charge. Atoms, for instance, consist of an atomic nucleus that contains neutral neutrons and **positively charged** protons, as well as orbiting electrons that are **negatively charged**. When an atom is in a neutral condition, the number of protons (+) and electrons (-) is equal. When the number of protons and electrons is not the same, the particle becomes an ion that is either positively or negatively charged. Positive ions are harmful to the human body, while negative ions are beneficial.

Negative ions are in the air that we breathe as well as in our bodies. They **neutralize** free radicals, revitalize cell metabolism and enhance immune function. In addition, they **purify** the blood and **balance** the autonomic nervous system, promoting **deep sleep** and healthy digestion. Negative ions also **protect** the body and mind from the harmful effects of environmental **stressors** such as electromagnetic fields. **Negative ions** are **naturally generated by evaporating water**.

**Electrons** are **highly sensitive to shock**, impact, electric current and atmospheric change. **Air pressure** or heat, for instance, can cause electrons to escape from atoms and dissipate, increasing the number of positive ions in the air.

In our daily lives, we can directly experience the electricity of ions in the air in the form of static electricity - especially in winter, when the **air is dry**. Static is caused by a **high ratio of positive** to negative ions because of a **lack** of moisture in the air.


## positive ions  

Are **small molecules** that have gained a positive charge. Most forms of pollution  

* toxic chemicals
* pet dander
* pollen
* mold

and other harmful chemicals in the air **carry a positive** electrical charge, making them positive ions.

Having (inhale) high levels of positive ions in the environment can lead to a **host of ailments**. This is because we are surrounded by positive ions from **electromagnetic fields** generated by computers, cell phones, and other electronic devices which can **impair brain** function and **suppress** the immune system causing symptoms such as:

* anxiety
* breathing difficulty
* fatigue
* headaches
* irritability
* lack of energy
* poor concentration
* nausea
* vertigo

## negative ions
Are the **opposite** of positive ions and they have the opposite effect on your **health**, mood, and energy levels.

We **inhale** negative ions in environments such as

* ocean
* mountains
* forests
* waterfalls

Once they reach our **bloodstream**, negative ions produce biochemical reactions that **increase** levels of the mood chemical serotonin, helping to alleviate depression, relieve stress, and boost energy.

They are **statically attracted** to airborne **particles** like dust, mold spores, pet dander, and other floating pollutants and potential allergens.. By **attaching** to these pollutants and allergens they give them a negative charge and, rather than drifting in the **air**, they are grounded and **fall** to the floor or nearest surface.  

## how to indoor

* Air purifier supporting negative ions.
* Negative ion generators by [IonPacific](https://ionbox.net/) products ([amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=IonPacific)) - produces 20m negative ions / second, valid for 46m2 apartment (otherwise take more than 1). 
* Surround yourself with plants. They clean the air by taking in **carbon dioxide** and breathing out fresh **oxygen** and **many negative ions**. Some plants release **higher** levels of negative ions than others (best choices are chrysanthemum, coconut palm, gerbera, and spider plant)
* [beeswax candles](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073DJK4G7)

## the ratio of negative to positive ions is crucial to health

The **ratio** of negative to positive ions is **crucial**, because negative ions are able to neutralize the **harmful** effects of positive ions. At the beginning of the 20th century, the ratio in the **atmosphere was 1.2 negative ions** for every positive ion. However, in recent years, the ratio has **reversed** and now there are **1.2 positive** ions for every negative ion. This is due to environmental hazards such as air and water pollution, electromagnetic fields, and other factors.

Positive and negative ions also exist in our bodies, and the ratio of ions in the air we breathe influences the ratio in our **bodies**. Ions enter the body through the lungs (inhalation) as well as through the skin. Then they travel through the **blood** and lymphatic systems to **cells** throughout the body.

Ions were first linked to human health by a **Japanese** medical study in **1910**, which showed that patients with **arthritis** experienced **greater pain** when weather fluctuations **elevated** the percentage of **positive** ions in the atmosphere.

**Cold fronts** and low pressure systems **increase** the percentage of **positive** ions in the atmosphere. Doctors in Japan report that under such conditions, the symptoms of their asthma and arthritis patients are **aggravated**, and the number of **strokes** increases.

When blood or urine samples from individuals reporting such symptoms are analyzed, extremely high levels of the stress hormone serotonin are detected. This hormone is known to be potentially harmful to the body at high levels, and it is thought that positive ions may work to increase serum serotonin. (**Negative** ions, on the other hand, **cause** the body to convert **excess** serotonin into a **harmless** compound).

**Positive ions turn into free radicals** in the body, oxidizing cells throughout the entire system. They **damage** healthy **cells** and increase the **acidity** of the blood. When cells are oxidized, lactic acid levels rise drastically, resulting in a variety of maladies, including cancer. The balance of the endocrine, immune, and autonomic nervous systems is thrown off, and blood and lymph circulation declines. As a result, aging processes accelerate, and premature aging occurs.

**Negative ions** work to **prevent** oxidation by neutralizing the free radicals in our cells. As a result, cells are **revitalized**, and immunity and **resistance** are strengthened. Negative ions also work to balance the autonomic nervous system and improve gastrointestinal function. They can relax the mind and body, **promote** deep sleep, increase metabolism, stabilize appetite and blood pressure, enhance recovery from physical exhaustion, and help one feel refreshed and invigorated. Negative ions are essential to overall health.

In [1975](https://books.google.cz/books?id=sqtdDwAAQBAJ&lpg=PT76&ots=dx33svdh3y&dq=%22Nanzandoh%20Medical%20Clinic%22%201975&pg=PT76#v=onepage&q=%22Nanzandoh%20Medical%20Clinic%22%201975&f=false), Nanzandoh Medical Clinic in **Japan** published some astonishing results from their research on **negative ion therapy**, finding it effective in the treatment of 

* high blood pressure
* rheumatoid arthritis
* arthritis
* tinnitus (ringing of the ears)

as well as for various disorders of the nervous, respiratory, and digestive systems, thyroid gland, and skin. It was also found to **speed recovery** from illness and slow aging processes.
