**Dirty electricity** is a form of electromagnetic pollution or radiation. It is also called **EMI** or electrical "noise". It refers to powerful, high frequency electrical energy traveling along the wiring in buildings where only standard 60-Hertz AC electricity **should be**. It is also frequently referred to as harmonic distortion as it interferes with and distorts the fundamental 60 Hertz sinusoidal wave form. This distortion also results in unusable energy that is usually called reactive energy.

The **human nervous system** is in essence an **electrical system** that through **electromagnetism** governs our bodily functions. Because it is electrical, it can be **influenced** by **outside** electrical and magnetic fields which in turn **can impact** how effectively the nervous system and related systems communicate and function. In particular it may result in **neuro-endocrine stress** as a result of its impact on both the sympathetic and parasympathetic control systems. Symptoms such as high blood pressure, sleep disorders due to melatonin deficiencies, nervousness, etc. are common. Multiple studies correlate EMF exposure with diseases such as cancer, neurological disease, reproductive disorders, immune dysfunction, and electromagnetic hypersensitivity.

## EMI doubts
1. Touching the laptop getting electrical buzz ? Translated into a **90 Hz** vibration!! use **Power Surge** , for the working station. Removes dirty electricity, the **hard disk** will be thankful too!  
	* [APC PM1W-FR](https://www.apc.com/shop/us/en/products/APC-Essential-SurgeArrest-1-outlet-230V-France/P-PM1W-FR) (**EMI** and **RFI** noise filtering)
		* when 'Maximum Input Current' = 16A  
	can cover 2 laptops + 2 monitors.
1. Play with apartment **electric power box switches**, switch off individually, wait **>= 1h** to see if there is a difference, is not appearing immediately!!! Perfectly, switch off, go for a walk outside.
