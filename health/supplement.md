# Creatine monohydrate

Is formed of three amino acids :  
* arginine
* glycine
* methionine

It is an amino acid derivative, naturally produced in the human body from the amino acids **glycine** and **arginine**, with an additional requirement for **methionine** to catalyze the transformation of guanidinoacetate to creatine. [src](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatine)  

**Dose** : 3.5gr / day, one month on, one month off..  

4gr creatine in 1kg any type of meat...

* Whey Protein - essential and not essential amino acids
* EAA - all essential amino acids
* BCAA - 3 most wamted essential amino acids

Proteins are the foundation **of amino acids**. In order to render amino acids form protein molecules proteins must be digested via the **gastrointestinal tract**, GI. This involves stomach hydrochloric acid secretion on large protein molecules, then pancreatic secretion of the protease breaking down longer amino chains, and finally the breakdown into smaller fragments in the small intestine to form free amino's and some small peptides with the enzyme peptidease. Most amino acids are then subject to transportation to the liver and some metabolism in the viscera (splanchec) area and the stomach mucosal area.   

Free **BCAA’s** are a little different in that they are directly **transported to the bloodstream through the liver**, while some exchange in the intestinal viscera and go directly to the bloodstream also. Most all amino acids can be degradated, broken down, in the liver effectively, with the **exception** of BCAA’s. The liver oxidizes the BCAA’s from their converted form called oxo-Keto acids. This means that basic BCAA’s are not metabolized by the liver directly. Ultimately large percentages of the BCAA’S are oxidized by the muscle tissue and some by fat (adipose) tissue The largest percentage of oxidation occurs in muscle tissue (Organ Specific Muscle) [src](https://www.huhs.edu/literature/BCAA.pdf)  

The three BCAAs are leucine, isoleucine, and valine. They’re considered the most **anabolic** of the nine EAAs and have therefore been marketed as a sports supplement. It is however possible that only leucine is especially anabolic, and that leucine taken alone is actually more anabolic than leucine taken with isoleucine and valine, due to competition for both absorption in the gut and entry into muscle tissue. [src](https://examine.com/supplements/branched-chain-amino-acids/)  

Several studies showed that **aromatic amino acids** (aka those have an aromatic ring in the side-chain) such as tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine might be useful in **treating** depression by **producing neurotransmitters**.  

Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) **compete** with **aromatic amino acids** to transfer from **blood-brain barrier**. Therefore, the **higher** BCAAs concentrations in the blood, the **lower** aromatic amino acids will be **observed** in the brain. Therefore, it is possible that reductions in brain concentrations of aromatic amino acids will subsequently reduce the synthesis and the **release of neurotransmitters** associated with aromatic amino acids.
