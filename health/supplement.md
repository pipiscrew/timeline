# Creatine monohydrate

Is formed of three amino acids :  
* arginine
* glycine
* methionine

It is an amino acid derivative, naturally produced in the human body from the amino acids **glycine** and **arginine**, with an additional requirement for **methionine** to catalyze the transformation of guanidinoacetate to creatine. [src](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatine)  

**Dose** : 3.5gr / day, one month om, one month off..

| Amino Acid               | Primary   functions                                                            |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Histidine                | Nerve protection, immune function                                              |
| Isoleucine (**BCAA**)    | Muscle metabolism, immune function, energy from fats and carbohydrates         |
| Leucine (**BCAA**)       | Muscle repair, blood sugar control, energy from fats, protein synthesis        |

| Threonine                | Structural tissue, immune function, fat metabolism                             |
| Tryptophan               | Used to make serotonin and melatonin, which regulate appetite, mood, and sleep |
| Valine (**BCAA**)        | Stimulates muscle growth and energy from carbohydrates                         |

**Dose** : 8-10.7gr / day.
