# Nutrients 
Nutrients in plants are **not always easily** digested. This is because plants may contain **antinutrients**. These are plant compounds that **reduce** the absorption of nutrients from the digestive system. In some cases, they can be eliminated almost completely.  

Beans and other legumes are often soaked in water **overnight** to improve their nutritional value, most of the antinutrients in these foods are found in the **skin**. Since many antinutrients are water-soluble, they simply **dissolve** when foods are soaked.  

**Sprouting** is a period in the life cycle of plants when they start **emerging** from the seed. This natural process is also known as **germination**.

This process **increases** the availability of **nutrients** in seeds, grains and legumes. During **sprouting**, changes take place within the seed that lead to the **degradation** of antinutrients such as phytate and protease inhibitors.

# In Vivo vs In Vitro
In **vivo** refers to when research or work is done with or within an entire, living organism. Examples can include studies in animal models or human clinical trials. In **vitro** is used to describe work that's performed outside of a living organism.  


# Antinutrients and digestibility (in vitro) of soaked, dehulled and germinated cowpeas (black-eyed pea)

Phytic acid, polyphenols, protein and starch digestibility (in vitro) in two varieties, namely CS-46 and CS-88, of soaked, dehulled and germinated cowpeas were determined. Soaking for 12 hours, dehulling of soaked seeds and germination for different time periods (24, 36 and 48 h) contributed significantly in reducing the phytic acid and polyphenol content of cowpeas. Removal of seed coat (dehulling) of soaked cowpeas reduced the polyphenols by 70-71%. Soaking (12 h) brought about an improvement in protein and starch digestibility which further increased after dehulling. Progressive increase in digestibility (protein and starch) was noticed, with an increase in germination period. Dehulling of soaked seeds was most effective in reducing the polyphenolic content, and germination in enhancing protein and starch digestibility.

# Small-Seeded Legumes as a Novel Food Source
The protein and phytochemical contents increased and total carbohydrates decreased from seeds to microgreens. Our findings proved for the first time that seeds, **sprouted** seeds, and especially microgreens of small-seeded legumes are **promising new sources** of ingredients for fortification of staple foods with **bioactive** compounds, minerals and nutrients.

The steps :  
* soaking a handful of dry peas in water for 12-24 hours.
* remove the water, add them on bowl, covered with the lid.
* for 4-10 days, one or τwo or three times a day, rinse.
  * always rinse the seeds with clean water at least 3 to 4 times / day, to avoid the risk of contamination
* store to fridge for max a week, don't eat those are brown.
* if some are unsprouted, is because the producer mixed new with old seeds.
* eat 1 or 2 cups / day.
