So today we're going to talk about how `sleep affects` the body what happens during normal sleep what happens when sleep is disrupted and what factors contribute to these disparities in sleep health and how they might be remedied.

What is sleep and briefly how is it studied?   
So sleep is a behavioral state um it occurs particularly mainly during the night we know that it can be measured by a variety of different approaches the diagnostic approach that we use to evaluate sleep disturbance is actually asking people how well they slept and whether they woke up during the night and whether they woke up repeatedly during the night and whether they could go back to sleep so people actually have a pretty good sense of how well they are sleeping and whether they're waking up feeling rested.  

About these different stages of sleep today one's a very kind of a light sleep which is typically called a stage one or two uh three and four are delta sleepers slow way sleep or deep sleep is where we get a really restorative functions for our sleep and then we have rem sleep or rem sleep rapid eye movement sleep which is the time when we dream and there are our EKG, our brain actually looks like it's awake.  

As compared to what's going on during the day except we are `completely paralyzed` we're not able to move our bodies our body except for our eyes move back and forth in these rapid eye movements from one side to the other so of course across the course of the night we go through each of these stages so sleep is a behavioral state it can be very readily evaluated by objective measures and we also have subjective scores that evaluate.  

If i understand right the body is actually `very busy` when we're sleeping, right ?  

i'm not talking about so much memory consolidation and things that are going on in the brain but in terms of the `immune system` tell us a little bit about when we get a good night's sleep what's going on in terms of the immune system. What's going on during sleep is a very active and `dynamic process` in which the `body and the brain` are communicating with each other throughout this period of a behavioral state and `allows the body then to restore` and to rest because there are changes in the metabolic demands on the body during that period of time and the brain and during sleep is coordinating those kinds of changes at the very at the more `cellular level` or molecular level we find changes in the immune system that are also occurring and one of the things that is happening is that all of the all of the bodily systems the `autonomic nervous system` the `hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis` which is the stress hormone processes and the `immune system` are all aligned with our `circadian rhythm` but there are also specific changes that occur during the night and during sleep that are driven `solely` by sleep so one of the measures that we often think about is `inflammatory measures`. Are really very important in a number of disease processes certainly they increase with aging that put just put at risk for `chronic diseases` of `aging` certain cancers / cardiovascular disease / dementia and also depression so these inflammatory products are very important and they're `regulated very tightly` by sleep processes one particular inflammatory `cytokine` is called interleukin-6 which is `secreted` by immune cells or inflammatory cells in the body and it communicates with other immune cells to `coordinate` the immune response **I don't want to give the impression that all inflammation is bad** because some inflammation is necessary in order for our immune system to respond to an infectious challenge of bacteria or virus and mount an effective immune response and so what's very key during the night is that the immune system is being `coordinated` by sleep and sleep is actually producing a mild activation of these inflammatory products which we believe is important for preparing the person for the kinds of risks and exposures that might occur during the day but also if a person has been exposed to an inflammatory agent or an infectious agent that that low-level inflammatory response allows immune system to respond as the person is resting during times of low metabolic demand so they could can be an effective metabolic and immunological response to that infectious challenge.  

What we know and what's increasingly recognized is that sleep is really now considered the `third pillar` of health so it's commonly accepted that `diet` is a pillar of health that `exercise` is a pillar of health. Sleep really affects our entire mental health our physical health really all aspects of health and there's been several studies and systematic reviews and analyses that have confirmed that that you know different `dimensions` of sleep.  

Being sleeping less than seven hours of sleep for example is associated with increased risk of premature mortality increased risk of cardiovascular disease / depression / cancer / cardio metabolic conditions like obesity diabetes hypertension really and in addition to increased risk of workplace accidents of motor vehicle accidents really it sort of is an important pillar of health it `touches` every facet of life and we start seeing effects on health.  

We know it's important in cancer / cardiovascular disease / dementia and depression, sleep is really driving most of many of those changes and we know that sleep disturbance is `occurring` in each of these disorders as well.  

But the i think the question that is often raised is **which comes first** does the `chronic disease` come first and then lead that to inflammation, does `inflammation come first ` leading to changes in these disease outcomes and we know from prospective studies that changes in the inflammation increases in inflammation are really very key in the risk of these diseases and that we can prospectively evaluate and look at measures of these inflammatory products early and then and then follow people over many years and find that the heart people with higher levels of these inflammatory products c-reactive protein (`CRP`) and `interleukin-6` are more at risk for each of these diseases that i mentioned we can also do studies of a similar nature and look at reported sleep disturbance and objective sleep disturbance and polysomnography measures and find that disturbances of sleep are also related to each of these disorders and importantly also related to an immortality and so there have now been a number of studies that have actually evaluated sleep and inflammation in a prospective designs and find and found that `sleep disturbance occurs first` leading to the increases in `inflammation` and then the inflammation mediates these increases in `disease` risk.  

We also know that when people have chronic diseases of inflow inflammatory activation such as cardiovascular disease / rheumatoid arthritis and also certain infections that changes the immune system occur which lead to alterations in sleep so this can produce a vicious cycle where you have a disease that's producing changes in inflammation and then changes in sleep and the changes in sleep produce further inflammation and further worsening the disease so very important strategies are to target either both of these particular mechanisms sleep or inflammation or one or the other and a number of groups throughout the country are interrogating that kind of two-hit approach to prevent depression and potentially alter risk for dementia and other neuropsychiatric disorders very interesting maybe we'll get to um circle back to that.  

I emphasize that other interventions such as `mindfulness` and `mindful` approaches such as `tai chi` or `yoga` are non-inferior that is **they're similar into their benefit improving sleep** and it appears that they may **also** have a very **important role** in the prevention of depression and people that have insomnia problems and sleep problems we also have data that the pathway that's leading to that prevention of depression is ability for the for as the sleep disturbance uh goes away inflammation goes away and the as that inflammation goes away the risk of depression also is mitigated or blossomed and so we think that there's actually these pathways that are occurring um reason that we're doing these kinds of studies all this experimental data that we've also accumulated where you could take people that have sleep disturbance or that have this acculturation stress or on this and severe stress in their communities and bring them into the laboratory and see how they respond to sleep loss and how they respond to immune activation and we know that these pathways are really salient for predicting who gets depressed and who doesn't get depressed and who can experience reward and pleasure in their lives and who doesn't and so we know that these all these factors are interacting and we need to then we're breaking those apart in these clinical trials and targeting one particular aspect versus another and finding uh benefit for the patients.  I encourage our your viewers to download our app called [UCLA Mindful](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.uclahealth.marc) has free meditations. Even when i was a medical student and also that was in the 80s i was practicing yoga and also engaged in some mindfulness practices to deal with the stress.  

I asking them how many hours are you sleeping well i'm getting almost seven hours of sleep. I'm not getting my full eight hours and I remind them that eight hours of sleep is not what you'd expect as you get `older` **seven** six and a half hours of sleep is is certainly within the **normal** range once you're older than 60 **65 years** of age as we age there are changes in our brain and there's changes in the nature of that sleep and one of the things that happens `beginning as early as 35 40` is that we begin to `lose` that `slow wave sleep` that `deep restorative sleep` and there's not really much you can do to get it back as you lose it over time but there's ways that can that can accelerate or slow it so if you **drink** a lot guess what your loss of slow waste sleep so it's very important to monitor your alcohol but as we mentioned there are `pillars` of health and good `diet` and particularly `exercise` is really critical for `maintenance` of good sleep and we know that when you exercise on a regular basis the amount of `slow wave sleep` that you will have during the night is `greater` so `exercise` has a `protective` role for a whole host of diseases and particularly probably through this activation of neurogenesis and neuroprotective processes which `preserves` the nature of sleep and also many other brain functions so **exercise** is **very important** so that's an approach I already mentioned `mindfulness` that also has `protective` approaches on the brain so there's biological changes that we can really not reverse and change **but there's other things** that we can do that can **slow** that on that trajectory of aging.  


Well a whole number of diseases that have an inflammatory basis can lead to sleep disturbance rheumatoid arthritis / cardiovascular disease / depression and so those are those comorbidities between that disorder and sleep disturbance are very common in additionally we also know that cancer patients and cancer survivors very high rates of sleep disturbance.
