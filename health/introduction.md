## Genome

A **genome** is an organism’s complete set of DNA. If the **DNA** code is a **set of instructions** that’s carefully organized into  

* paragraphs (**genes**) 
* chapters (**chromosomes**)

then the entire manual from start to finish would be the **genome**.

**Genes** encode protein, large complex molecules which drive processes in the body and are responsible for the function and structure of the body's tissues. Before **genes** can be used to make proteins, their DNA sequence is transcribed into **RNA**, an intermediary molecule that contains the instructions for making **proteins**.

The human **genome** contains approximately 3 billion of these base pairs, which reside in the **23 pairs of chromosomes** within the **nucleus** of all our **cells**. Each **chromosome** contains hundreds to thousands of **genes**, which carry the instructions for making **proteins**. Each of the estimated 30,000 genes in the human genome makes an average of three proteins. [src](https://www.genome.gov/human-genome-project/Completion-FAQ)

When a **gene** is activated by signals from inside or outside the **cell**, it makes a molecular message (called an **RNA**) that contains all the information needed to make whatever that **gene makes**. We now know that over 95% of our **genes** can actually make several **different** types of messages, depending on the **needs** of the **cell**.

## DNA

The DNA inside each of your cells is longer than you are, but packs down into a space smaller than you can see.

Stretched DNA length in each human cell is about 2 meters.

All the DNA in all your cells put together would be about twice the diameter of the Solar System.

## Cells

Almost every cell of your body contains the **23 pairs of chromosomes**, except the eggs and sperm that contain only one copy (so only 23 and not 23 pairs). The only cells that don't contain DNA are **blood cells** because they don't have a **nucleus** (the structure that keeps the DNA).
The DNA are the **instructions** that the cell has to produce all its components, like **proteins** and function properly. So they are needed everywhere.

## Mitochondria

Are found in all **cells**, with the exception of a few. There are usually **multiple mitochondria** found in one **cell**, depending upon the function of **cell**.

Are the **powerhouses** for cells, providing energy to carry out biochemical reactions and other cellular processes. Mitochondria make energy for cells from the chemical energy stored in the **food** we eat.. It's funny, they do literally run like a dam generating hydroelectric power! - They pump **protons** (positively charged particles) one way, then use them as they slide back to run a kind of motor that makes a small **energetic molecule** used by many entities in the **cell**.

**Food** contains the building blocks of life known as  

* carbohydrates  
* proteins  
* fats

The **energy** stored in food is converted into a **usable energy source** in the **body** known as **ATP**. ATP is the only energy currency that can be used in our **bodies**. The actual **production of ATP** is quite a **complex** process. The **inner membrane** of **mitochondria** is what is responsible for **mass energy production**.

## Proteins

> **Proteins** are made up of hundreds of smaller units called **amino acids** that are attached to one another by peptide bonds, forming a long chain. You can think of a protein as a **string of beads** where each bead is an **amino acid**.  
> A single **cell** can contain **thousands** of proteins, each with a **unique** function.

Proteins can play a wide array of roles in a cell or organism.

* **Enzymes** act as catalysts in biochemical reactions, meaning that they speed the reactions up.

* **Hormones** are long-distance chemical signals released by endocrine cells. While some hormones are **steroid-based**, others are **proteins**. These protein-based hormones are commonly called **peptide hormones**. For example, **insulin** is an important peptide hormone, the **hemoglobin** protein that carries oxygen in the blood is a **globular** protein, while **collagen**, found in our skin, is a **fibrous** protein.

* **Antibodies**  

  

Types of proteins and their functions are listed in the table below:

| Role              | Examples                                     | Functions                                                                   |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Digestive enzyme  | Amylase, lipase, pepsin                      | Break down nutrients in food into small pieces that can be readily absorbed |
| Transport         | Hemoglobin                                   | Carry substances throughout the body in blood or lymph                      |
| Structure         | Actin, tubulin, keratin                      | Build different structures, like the cytoskeleton                           |
| Hormone signaling | Insulin, glucagon                            | Coordinate the activity of different body systems                           |
| Defense           | Antibodies                                   | Protect the body from foreign pathogens                                     |
| Contraction       | Myosin                                       | Carry out muscle contraction                                                |
| Storage           | Legume storage proteins, egg white (albumin) | Provide food for the early development of the embryo or the seedling        |

**Amino acids** are the monomers that make up proteins. Specifically, a protein is made up of one or more linear chains of amino acids, each of which is called a **polypeptide**. There are **20 types** of amino acids commonly found in proteins.

**hemoglobin** molecule consist by 574 amino acids

----------


The human body, minus water, is **75% amino acids**. All of the **neurotransmitters** (proteins) but one are composed of amino acids; and **95% of hormones** are amino acids. Amino acids are **key to every human bodily function** with every chemical reaction that occurs.

Amino acids **occur naturally** in certain foods, such as :  

* dairy products  
* meats  
* fish  
* poultry  
* nuts  
* legumes  
* eggs  

Those sources are considered more complete than **vegetable** protein, such as beans, peas, and grains, also considered a good—even if not complete—source of amino acids. Although **plant sources** generally lack one or more of the essential amino acids, when **combined** with **whole grains** such as **rice**, or by eating **nuts** or seeds with **legumes**, all the amino acids can be **obtained**. e.g., **cereal grains** have too little of the essential amino acid **lysine** and **legumes** usually lack the essential amino acids  

* methionine  
* tryptophane  

The proteins of commonly **cultivated mushrooms** contain **all** nine amino acids **essential**. For all mushrooms, the most **abundant** essential amino acid is **lysine**, and the **lowest** levels among the essential amino acids are those of  

* tryptophane    
* methionine  


Of the **20 amino acids** required for manufacturing the proteins the human body needs, the body itself **produces** only **12**, meaning that we have to meet our requirements for the other **eight through nutrition**. Because each amino acid can be used many times along the chain and because there are **no restrictions** on the length of the chain, the number of possible combinations for the formation of proteins is **truly enormous**. There are about **two quadrillion different proteins** that can exist if each of the 20 amino acids present in humans is used **only once**.

The **essential amino acids**, which are **derived** only from **food** and that the body cannot manufacture, perform various functions :

* **Tryptophan** - This is considered a natural relaxant, helps alleviate insomnia; helps in the treatment of migraine headaches; helps reduce the risk of artery and heart spasms; and works with lysine to reduce cholesterol levels.
* **Lysine** - Aids in proper absorption of calcium ; helps form collagen for bone cartilage and connective tissues; aids in production of antibodies, hormones, and enzymes. Research has indicated it also might be effective against herpes by creating the balance of nutrients that slows the growth of the virus causing it. A deficiency could result in fatigue , lack of concentration, irritability, bloodshot eyes, retarded growth, hair loss, anemia , and reproductive problems.
* **Methionine** - Properties include providing the primary source of sulfur that can prevent disorders of the hair, skin, and nails; lowers cholesterol by increasing the liver's production of lecithin ; reduces liver fat; protects kidneys; and promotes hair growth.
* **Phenylalanine** - This serves the brain by producing norepinephrine, the chemical that is responsible for transmitting the signals between the nerve cells and the brain; can maintain alertness; reduces hunger pains; acts as an antidepressant; and improves memory.
* **Threonine** - Makes up a substantial portion of the collagen, elastin, and enamel protein; serves the liver by preventing buildup; aids the digestive and intestinal tracts to function better; and acts as a trigger for metabolism.
* **Valine** - Promotes mental energy; helps with muscle coordination; and serves as a natural tranquilizer.
* **Leucine** - Works with **Isoleucine** to provide for the manufacture of essential biochemical processes in the body that are used for energy, increasing the stimulants to the upper brain for greater mental alertness.

> Complete Protein  

A protein is comprised of 20 amino acids; 11 of these amino acids are produced by the human body. For good health, we must get the other **nine** amino acids (called "essential amino acids") from the foods we eat. When a food contains all nine of these amino acids, it is called a "complete protein." can be found :

 * Animal proteins, such as meat, eggs, and milk. Provide the highest-quality protein sources.  
 * Quinoa
 * Buckwheat
 * Hempseed
 * Soybeans
 * [Chlorella](https://www.echlorial.fr/en/content/17-analyse-detaillee) (algae) [2](https://www.echlorial.fr/en/content/18-chlorella-composition)

As supplement - **BCAA** (Branch Chain Amino Acids)

Of the nine essential amino acids, **three** are the **branched-chain** amino acids (BCAAs):   

* Leucine  
* Isoleucine  
* Valine  

Branched-chain refers to the chemical structure of BCAAs, which are **found in protein-rich** foods such as eggs, meat and dairy products.

## Amino Acid Neurotransmitters

* Glutamate

	It’s present in **90 percent** of **synapses**, acting as the main **excitatory** neurotransmitter in the **central nervous** system. It only takes a small amount of glutamate to **excite neighbor** brain cells. Too much glutamate can be **tricky** for your brain. Excesses can over-excite cells. So much so that neurons **can’t bring their energy back down** again. This toxic excited state causes brain cells to **lock up** and **stop** working. Good thing those transporter proteins are there to clear away the extra glutamate and **protect your brain** by cleaning up the synapse after each action potential.

	**Neuroplasticity** also relies on **glutamate**. That’s because your brain uses glutamate to **build** pathways between neurons that reinforce your memory and help you learn.  
  
* Aspartate  
* GABA  
* Glycine

## Does a vegan diet lead to poorer bone health?
The vegan diet is on trend. How this type of diet affects health is the subject of scientific studies. Out of 28 parameters of nutritional status and bone metabolism, it was possible to identify twelve biomarkers most strongly associated with bone health – for example, the  

* amino acid lysine
* vitamin A
* vitamin B6
  
The results show that in most cases, the combination of these biomarkers was present in lower concentrations in vegans. [source](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-03/bfif-dav030421.php)  

## Intermittent Fasting
Is an eating plan that switches between fasting and eating on a regular schedule. After hours without food, the body exhausts its **sugar stores** and starts burning fat, lets call it **metabolic switching**.  

Research shows that it can take **two to four weeks** before the body becomes accustomed to intermittent fasting. You might feel hungry or cranky while you’re getting used to the new routine. But research subjects who make it through the adjustment period tend to **stick** with the plan, because they **notice they feel better**.

When changes occur with this metabolic switch, it affects the body and brain. Many things happen during intermittent fasting that can protect organs against chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes, heart disease, age-related neurodegenerative disorders, even inflammatory bowel disease and many cancers. [src](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/intermittent-fasting-what-is-it-and-how-does-it-work)  

**16 / 8 fasting**: eating for eight hours and fasting for 16. From **12pm - 8pm** you can eat what you want then fast for 16 hours. During fast can drink water, coffee, tea and other non-caloric beverages. Do not add sugar to your coffee.

When you fast, **several things happen** in your body on the cellular and molecular level.

For example, your body **adjusts hormone levels** to make stored body fat more accessible.

Your **cells** also **initiate important repair processes** and change the expression of genes.

Here are some changes that occur in your body when you fast:
* Human Growth Hormone (HGH)
* Insulin
* Cellular repair
* Gene expression
* Brain health
* Reduce Inflammation

> Isn’t It Unhealthy to Skip Breakfast  

No. The problem is that most stereotypical breakfast skippers have unhealthy lifestyles. If you make sure to eat healthy food for the rest of the day then the practice is perfectly healthy. [source](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/intermittent-fasting-guide)
