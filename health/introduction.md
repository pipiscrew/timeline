## Genome

A **genome** is an organism’s complete set of DNA. If the **DNA** code is a **set of instructions** that’s carefully organised into paragraphs (**genes**) and chapters (**chromosomes**), then the entire manual from start to finish would be the **genome**.

**Genes** encode protein, large complex molecules which drive processes in the body and are responsible for the function and structure of the body's tissues. Before **genes** can be used to make proteins, their DNA sequence is transcribed into **RNA**, an intermediary molecule that contains the instructions for making **proteins**.

The human **genome** contains approximately 3 billion of these base pairs, which reside in the **23 pairs of chromosomes** within the **nucleus** of all our **cells**. Each **chromosome** contains hundreds to thousands of **genes**, which carry the instructions for making **proteins**. Each of the estimated 30,000 genes in the human genome makes an average of three proteins. [src](https://www.genome.gov/human-genome-project/Completion-FAQ)

When a **gene** is activated by signals from inside or outside the **cell**, it makes a molecular message (called an **RNA**) that contains all the information needed to make whatever that **gene makes**. We now know that over 95% of our **genes** can actually make several **different** types of messages, depending on the **needs** of the **cell**.

**Proteins** are made up of hundreds of smaller units called **amino acids** that are attached to one another by peptide bonds, forming a long chain. You can think of a protein as a **string of beads** where each bead is an **amino acid**.

## DNA

The DNA inside each of your cells is longer than you are, but packs down into a space smaller than you can see.

Stretched DNA length in each human cell is about 2 meters.

All the DNA in all your cells put together would be about twice the diameter of the Solar System.

## Cells

Almost every cell of your body contains the **23 pairs of chromosomes**, except the eggs and sperm that contain only one copy (so only 23 and not 23 pairs). The only cells that don't contain DNA are **blood cells** because they don't have a **nucleus** (the structure that keeps the DNA).
The DNA are the **instructions** that the cell has to produce all its components, like **proteins** and function properly. So they are needed everywhere.

## Mitochondria

Are found in all **cells**, with the exception of a few. There are usually **multiple mitochondria** found in one **cell**, depending upon the function of **cell**.

Are the **powerhouses** for cells, providing energy to carry out biochemical reactions and other cellular processes. Mitochondria make energy for cells from the chemical energy stored in the **food** we eat.. It's funny, they do literally run like a dam generating hydroelectric power! - They pump **protons** (positively charged particles) one way, then use them as they slide back to run a kind of motor that makes a small **energetic molecule** used by many entities in the **cell**.

**Food** contains the building blocks of life known as  

* carbohydrates  
* proteins  
* fats

The **energy** stored in food is converted into a **usable energy source** in the **body** known as **ATP**. ATP is the only energy currency that can be used in our **bodies**. The actual **production of ATP** is quite a **complex** process. The **inner membrane** of **mitochondria** is what is responsible for **mass energy production**.
