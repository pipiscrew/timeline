# CBD Tea

When prepared with 1 teaspoon of CBD (cannabidiol) in 200 ml of warm water, CBD tea can have several effects on the body due to the properties of CBD. Here’s a breakdown of what happens:

1. **Absorption**: When you drink CBD tea, the CBD is absorbed through the digestive system. The warm water can help dissolve the CBD, making it easier for your body to absorb it.

2. **Interaction with the Endocannabinoid System**: CBD interacts with the endocannabinoid system (ECS), which plays a crucial role in regulating various physiological processes, including mood, pain sensation, immune response, and sleep. CBD does not bind directly to cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) but influences them indirectly, which can help promote balance in the body.

3. **Potential Effects**
   - **Anxiety and Stress Relief**: Many users report that CBD can help reduce feelings of anxiety and stress. This is thought to be due to its interaction with serotonin receptors in the brain.
   - **Pain Relief**: CBD may have anti-inflammatory properties, which can help alleviate pain and discomfort.
   - **Improved Sleep**: Some people find that CBD helps them relax and improves their sleep quality, potentially due to its calming effects.
   - **Digestive Health**: CBD may also have a positive effect on the digestive system, potentially helping with issues like nausea or inflammation.

4. **Onset and Duration**: The effects of CBD tea can vary based on individual metabolism, the concentration of CBD, and other factors. Generally, the effects may take longer to onset compared to other methods of consumption (like vaping or tinctures) because it has to pass through the digestive system. Users might start to feel effects within 30 minutes to 2 hours, and the effects can last for several hours.

5. **Hydration**: Drinking CBD tea also contributes to hydration, which is essential for overall health and can enhance the effects of CBD.

6. **Individual Variability**: It's important to note that individual responses to CBD can vary widely. Factors such as body weight, metabolism, and individual biochemistry can influence how one experiences the effects of CBD.

The **common dose** for teas when using 200-240 ml of boiling water is typically, `1 to 2 teaspoons` (2 to 4 grams). Consuming it in excessive amounts (ex 1 tablespoon (15 grams)) may lead to side effects such as drowsiness, nausea, or allergic reactions.  

All types of tea, including **green tea** and **black tea** and **white tea** and **Oolong** and **Pu-erh** can **inhibit** `iron absorption` due to their tannin content. Tannins are polyphenolic compounds that can bind to iron and reduce its bioavailability.  

**Chamomile tea** does **not have** a significant effect on `iron absorption`, and **CBD tea** impact on iron absorption is not well-studied, but it is generally considered to have a **neutral effect** in this regard.

**All teas** made from the leaves of the same plant, `Camellia sinensis`. The differences among these types of tea arise primarily from the processing methods used after the leaves are harvested.
