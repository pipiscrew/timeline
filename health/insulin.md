The `power of hormones` becomes clear if you consider the example of **adrenaline**. Anyone who has experienced panic knows what it feels like: rocketing fear, racing heart, explosive perspiration. Hormones carry massively powerful effects.

`Insulin` is also a hormone, once released by the **pancreas**. Here’s how it works: When **carbohydrate foods** reach your upper intestine, they trigger another key hormone, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). This carb-driven spurt of GIP **streaks** to your **pancreas** and to your **fat cells**. In the pancreas, it triggers a **surge** of **insulin release**. In fat cells, it **gets things ready** for **fat-storage mode**. The **surge of insulin flashes around your body**, triggering your cells to get ready to **absorb glucose**. It `stops` the release of other hormones, such as glucagon, in order to prevent inappropriate glucose production in your liver. It tells the `hypothalamus` in your brain that glucose is on the way **in order** to control your **appetite**. It tells your body to `stop burning fat` and **preferentially** burn the **glucose** coming down the hatch (glucose is dangerous if it remains at a high level in the bloodstream), so it **must be prioritized** for **burning immediately** or be **turned** into body **fat for storage**. Insulin does all this and much more, it is truly the master `regulator of your body`.

If you keep your **insulin levels low**, all these **signals are highly effective**. Your body will stay exquisitely sensitive to insulin messages. `This is pivotal for longevity and slimness`. There are many strategies for keeping your insulin low. Here are a couple of the most important approaches :
* Don’t consume too much carb, which is mainly, made up of glucose. 
* Don’t consume processed carb or processed v**egetable oils**. 
* Absolutely don’t ingest carbs along with fatty foods (a very bad combo indeed).
* Don’t consume too much fructose.
* Do not eat frequently, rather, eat well-spaced meals (2-3 / day). Snacking screws up your insulin signaling.

**Excessive carb drives excessive insulin**. Processed carb in particular leads to explosive glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) release in the gut—driving truly excessive insulin.  

Carb and fat together really jack up GIP and consequently insulin.  

**Fructose** drives insulin problems in the liver, **promoting bad cholesterol** along the way. These are the main mechanisms that a low-carb, high-fat diet `tackles`.  

There are also emerging studies that show that **gut microbiome** problems (issues with the balance of good and bad bacteria in your gut) can also drive **insulin dysregulation**.  

**Carbohydrate-rich** foods raise blood sugar levels. Insulin must be promptly raised to manage this blood sugar. **Carbohydrate-rich** foods are also poorly satiating to begin with (they don’t fill you up and keep you feeling full). The overall **effect** is that you **feel hungry again** soon after a meal. The spring is difficult to ignore it will **whisper** in your ear, `You really need and deserve a snack`.

Overweight and `unhealthy people` normally have **higher** insulin levels, a condition known as **hyperinsulinemia**. Unfortunately, they also respond less well to insulin’s orders, even though they have higher insulin levels, just as with any powerful drug, you can **become resistant** to the **effects** of **insulin over time**. This phenomenon is called `insulin resistance`. In fact, the majority of **adult Americans** now have an [insulin resistance problem](https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2015.10029). And a shocking proportion of our children have it, [too](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc06-0709). A high level of insulin in the bloodstream with associated insulin resistance is the **signature** dysfunction of `our modern age`.

In **type 2 diabetes**, `insulin resistance` has progressed to the point that the **body has lost control** of blood **glucose** levels. Most **heart disease** is driven by diabetic vascular inflammation: high insulin and glucose levels **damage** the walls of your **arteries**, which leads to the **buildup** of **materials** in the **artery walls**. This process is called `atherosclerosis`, and it is the primary driver of heart attacks.

Every time we **eat**, energy is **stored** in multiple different **compartments in our bodies**. That energy is then **released steadily** to fuel our activity when we are not eating. Think of your **personal energy storage** as a rechargeable battery in an electric car. When you eat, your batteries get charged up. Between meals, the batteries provide a steady release of energy to keep you alive. Let’s briefly look at **how carbohydrate** and **fat** play into this process :

1) The **glucose** from food you eat is used for your body immediate needs, and whatever remains is **first stored** in the **glycogen battery**. This glycogen reserve can hold around **2,000 calories** worth of **glucose**. These are short-term batteries, in the absence of food, they **run out within a day** or so. When glycogen is **full**, you **will not** be in a **good state** for the **healthy burning of fat**. The **healthiest state** is one in which `glycogen remains incompletely full`.
2) When the **glycogen battery** becomes **full**, **excess glucose** is converted into **special fats** that are released from the **liver** into the **bloodstream**. This process can drive up your `bad cholesterol` (LDL) and promote many other **problems** in the body. It is a **very different phenomenon** from the healthy processing of **dietary fat**. The **healthiest state is one** in which glucose is `not converted into these fats`.
3) The **final storage** depot is your body fat, or adipose tissue. The **storage capacity** here is **huge**, but most overweight people d**on’t tap into it**. The **healthiest state** is one in which this battery is **used almost exclusively**. To achieve this, you must stop drawing on glycogen (#1) and stop creating the special fats in your liver (#2).  

**Healthy dietary fats** are the `safest fuel` in a well-formulated low-carb diet. They **directly enable you** to **minimize** your intake of **glucose**, and so achieve the **optimization** of 1 to 3 above. In doing so, you can help keep your adipose tissue in good health and insulin sensitive.

Your **body cells** do not **burn** both **glucose** and **fat** at the **same time**. In fact, the **core fat-burning mechanisms** are intentionally shut down when **glucose** enters your system. Mammals always **prioritize** burning **glucose** when it is **present**, which makes sense, because `glucose is toxic to cells` when it is at **elevated** levels. Note that we only carry about **1.5 teaspoons of glucose in our entire blood** supply. If it **rises** much beyond that, it will damage the **body organ** systems. Fat, on the **other hand**, is **easy** for the **body** to **store** and **reuse**. `But fat is not easy to tap into if carb is the main part of your meals`.  

The standard **American diet** relies primarily on **carb—in fact**, the **government** has told for decades to make `healthy whole grains` the bulk of our **calories**. And most Americans are **sugar-burners**. What are the major implications of this higher-carb dietary strategy?
* You experience blood `sugar` and insulin `spikes`. This **downregulates** the fat-burning machinery. For many, this can promote a **speedier** onset of `post-meal hunger pangs`. Over time, `insulin spikes` can lead to `insulin resistance`. With **increasing** insulin levels, the negative aspects of the diet become **magnified**.
You miss out on the benefits of **nutrient-dense** foods high in h**ealthy fat** and **protein**. For many, hunger pangs start sooner after meals that **lack** fat and protein. This promotes larger, hunger-driven meals and `snacking behavior`. A relative deficiency in fat-soluble nutrients can promote appetite to compensate for their lack.  
  
Lets contrast the above with a diet that focuses on **healthy fats** and keeps **carb** intake **low**. The implications of this diet are as follows :
* You will m**inimize blood sugar** and i**nsulin spikes**. This **upregulates** your fat-burning machinery and reduces your **dependency** on sugar. It **enhances** smooth burning of body fat between meals, suppressing appetite and enabling you to **skip meals** without undue hunger. Over time, your **insulin resistance** levels will **fall** steadily, `and with them your risk of chronic disease`.
* You will gain access to a whole range of **nutrient-dense foods**, which will enhance your health and vitality.  

The above is only a **brief summary** of the **advantages** that come with a `high-healthy-fat diet`. In short, a **higher-carb** diet promotes a **sugar-burning physiology**, which directly **impedes** your fat-burning ability. This is the very last thing that you want, for either weight loss or longevity. But the worst thing about being a **sugar-burner** over the long term is that it drives up your risk of acquiring the most `prevalent disease in our world today`, which in turn underpins the `risk for most diseases` of modernity—heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer, and many cancers. We call this disease state **metabolic insulin resistance syndrome** (`MIRS`) and the **last thing you want** to be on is the **MIRS diet**.

> A diet that’s high in both **fats** and **carbs** is the **worst** possible diet and will lead straight to **MIRS**.  

We have an **explosion** of **health problems** today. Obesity, type 2 diabetes, and a shocking array of afflictions associated with them are rampant. The dysfunctions of obesity and diabetes are so closely **interlinked** that the term `diabesity` has been coined, and the incidence of **fatty liver disease**— which is **intimately connected** to the **foods** we eat, just like obesity and type 2 diabetes—has increased massively; over a third of US citizens now have **fatty liver**, whereas in the 1960s, the condition was mostly confined to **alcohol abusers**.

> Having fat around your internal organs is linked to all kinds of chronic disease.

In sum, you have a serious **MIRS problem** if you suffer from three or more of the following conditions:
* Low HDL ("good cholesterol")
* High triglycerides (fats in your blood)
* Large waist size
* High blood pressure
* High blood sugar  

No world authorities bother including `LDL` (bad cholesterol), because it has little relevance to disease for most people.

When we take in **glucose** and **fructose** together in high quantities (as in table sugar and HFCS), we experience an unfortunate double punch. The **glucose** ramps up insulin, which tends to direct the **fructose** toward conversion into fat—making you fat. The fructose-driven fat can also end up in your liver, pancreas, and other organs: another unfortunate way for your diet to **fail**.  

> **Refined carbs** cause very detrimental hormone responses in your digestive tract. Specifically, they cause your levels of the hormone GIP to flare up. GIP is a primary trigger for insulin release, and insulin **spikes** to rally to the rescue of your elevated blood sugar.
> **Processed carbohydrate** leads to a form of **addiction** over time.

Alzheimer epidemic, with some leading researchers now **calling** the disease `type 3 diabetes` because it’s related to insulin resistance in the brain. Cardiovascular disease are steadily growing out of control—yet **another** high-insulin issue.  

The more **hyperinsulinemia** and **insulin resistance** you have, the **higher your risk** of death, not just from cardiovascular disease but also from a dizzying range of common diseases that drive early mortality, including Alzheimer’s, cancer, and other diseases of the liver, kidneys, and other organs.   
  
We must always **remind ourselves** that `type 2 diabetes` is a disease of **hyperinsulinemia** (high insulin) and insulin resistance, not a disease of blood sugar. It is fundamentally a disease of `damaged insulin signaling`. Diabetes became **mistakenly defined** as a disease of blood glucose levels. The implications of the mistake have been devastating.  

We now have `insulin` (for glucose), `mTOR` (for protein), and `leptin` (for fat). The **interplay** of these sensors is critically important. Insulin and leptin are hormones released by our **pancreas** and our fat cells, respectively. **mTOR** is like a complex microprocessor that responds to dietary protein directly, but also to all other dietary elements **through** insulin and other diet-driven signals—it integrates the signals from many other feedback loops. All `three sensors work together` to keep our bodies running **optimally**. They manage the harsh nutritional environments we encounter. When their signaling is damaged, disease results.  

When **insulin** and **glucose** are high, exposing us to factors that disrupt our cellular-signaling systems, our cells tend toward triggering their ancient genetic desire to reproduce **as fast as possible**. We now have a name for this kind of phenomenon. We call it cancer.  

> He has elegantly demonstrated that **insulin**, a nearly billion-year-old molecule, dominates our disease landscape.  

## heart
Most heart attacks are caused by **atherosclerosis**, the inflammation of the arterial walls. The primary cause of **cardiac death** is damage to your coronary arteries (the blood vessels that feed the heart muscle itself) as a result of **sustained inflammation**. This damage can lead to a heart attack, and in around `50 percent` of cases, this will result in death.  

There are a few things that can **happen** in damaged coronary arteries to **cause** a heart attack  
* plaque on the arterial walls can break off and form a blood clot that blocks the flow of blood
* the arterial wall itself can rupture or spasm, interrupting the flow of blood  
    
but no matter what triggers a heart attack, the **body response** to damaged coronary arteries is always the **same**, and that response is **what the CAC scan directly observes and quantifies**.  

Your body **tries** to repair itself by `depositing calcium` in the `damaged areas` of the arterial wall. As the damage continues, these repair processes **quicken**. They **desperately attempt** to shore up the arterial walls before a rupture occurs. This `growing calcium` becomes the **telltale sign** of **imminent danger** , the ultimate canary in the coal mine or visible tip of an iceberg, the vital evidence of your real risk of sudden death. And it can be clearly and `easily measured with a CAC scan`.  

The **left anterior** descending artery, which is the responsible for the **greatest number of deaths** from heart attacks. Cardiologists have given a well-earned name to this artery: `the widowmaker`.  

For about $150 and a few minutes of your time, you can get your `CAC score`.  
* A CAC score `of 0` is good—you can relax.
* Between `1 and 80` is a concern, and you should be reconsidering your lifestyle. 
* Between `81 and 400` means it’s time to take serious action to attend to root causes. 
* Greater `than 400` means it’s write-the-will time—or else address all root causes immediately so you can get to safety.  

People who have very high CAC scores need to take **action fast**. Their arteries will likely **rupture** in the coming years (no nice retirement). Even people with a [Framingham Risk](https://www.mdcalc.com/calc/38/framingham-risk-score-hard-coronary-heart-disease) of 10 percent can be highly diseased, though some are just fine. Who is who? We simply look at the **proper** measure (their `CAC score`).

The only snag: you **can’t lower** your CAC score **with the orthodox** approach of a low-fat diet and medication ;)

A final reminder on the meaning of the CAC score: it tells you what was **happening in your arteries in the past**, up to the time when you got the scan. It is your **summed-up history of inflammatory damage**. If you get a high score, don’t panic.  

`CAC scan`, is a `CT scan` of the heart that **measures coronary artery calcification** (CAC). It shows where your body has **tried to repair damaged arteries** by depositing calcium in the arterial walls, so it reveals how much heart disease you have and also how much inflammatory damage you have sustained over the years. The CAC scan can really help bring clarity where the risk factors can confuse. This is particularly true if you track how your CAC score changes over time. Because it sees the actual evidence of **inflammatory disease** impact in your body, it essentially gives you the bottom line on your health status. It does not just show the extent of coronary heart disease—it really reflects the **damage** from the broad root causes of **modern chronic disease**. Therefore, it can be very useful for anyone tracking their progress toward achieving optimal health. Subsequent scan results would then tell a **more** compelling story than any blood tests. It gives incredibly useful information about your genuine health status and risk for chronic disease. For instance, if you have a **score of zero** in middle age, your risk of allcause mortality is extremely low. A zero score is being called `a warranty for humans`. Striving to keep this zero score into old age is the ultimate strategy for health and longevity. Nothing else comes close, because the CAC scan sees **how the disease itself progresses**. If you get a score higher than zero, all is not lost by any means. The key is to now stop your score from rising significantly over the years. You can achieve this by applying the ten action steps like a pro. The key is to keep your CAC score from increasing more than 15 percent per year. Ideally, it will increase by only 5 percent per year or less. You do not need to reverse your score; the vast majority of the longevity benefits will come from keeping the progression at a low level. You don’t need to get a CAC scan very often at all. If you have a low score (0 to 10), you might check in **five to seven years later**. If you have a very high score (higher than 400), then it would be prudent to check back within **two years** to verify that progression has been brought under control.

## insulin
The **insulin axis** is particularly **associated** with
* cancers of the breast
* endometrium
* prostate
* colon
* and lung, among several others  

**Most** of the really serious cancers with the **highest mortality rates** are right there in that list.  

**Insulin-like** growth factor 1, or `IGF-1`, is a cell-growth-signaling molecule that is very similar to insulin.  

**Insulin** was the **original growth** signal, **while IGF-1 later** evolved to **take over some functions**. Both insulin and IGF-1 have sensors and receptors **all over** the body. Insulin and IGF-1 **work together** in a system that is often referred to as the `insulin/IGF-1 axis`. In fact, insulin and IGF-1 are so **closely related** that they can **activate each other receptors**, and they are intimately connected on many levels. This interconnectivity extends to their **influence** on issues like obesity, diabetes, and cancer.  


## the 1950 lie still driving the world

Ancel Keys believed (1950s) in his heart that **dietary fat** (particularly saturated fat) was a key cause of coronary heart disease (CHD).  

Concluded that **heart disease** was caused by **elevated cholesterol** in the blood. It wasn’t such a far-fetched notion, because the plaque in diseased coronary arteries contains a fair amount of cholesterol, so it was a reasonable hypothesis that cholesterol in the diet would end up in the blood and could then find its way into the lining of arteries. But after careful study, Ancel Keys concluded the **fat in the diet, not cholesterol**, was thereal culprit. Ancel Keys **dominated** the field of **nutritional research**, especially where dietary fat, cholesterol, and heart disease were concerned. It is impossible to overestimate the **influence** his theories exert on us still **today**. His influence was such that Ancel Keys appeared on the cover of **Time magazine in 1961**. By this time, the battle against **saturated fat** was fully engaged, and **heart-healthy polyunsaturated fats** were the new **darlings** of the nutritional world. Fifteen years later, the McGovern Committee formulated the first **Dietary Goals** of the United States, which **hewed** closely to the ideas put forth by Ancel Keys: **keep the fat low** and keep it polyunsaturated. `Saturated fat` became a **dirty word**. It was almost never written as **saturated fat** but instead as **artery-clogging saturated fat**.

In their misguided way—thanks to the legacy of Ancel Keys—they encourage their patients to cut the fat, especially saturated fat, and **increase the carbohydrates** to try to drive their cholesterol levels **ever lower**. The sad, but predictable, result is an inexorable increase in weight and perhaps the **onset of diabetes**.

In spite of his personal passion, Ancel Keys did **not get very far** in the scientific community with his **Six Countries analysis** (in fact, he was humiliated at a World Health Organization gathering of scientists) and an excellent paper was published in **1957** in the [New York State Journal of Medicine](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/i4vti47bhsxbgfuianvul/Fat-in-the-diet-and-mortality-from-heart-disease_1957.pdf?rlkey=2wpn0ijmafsn7tqda8ut7r7dm&dl=1) that eviscerated his correlational capers. Ancel Keys was furious. So how did he proceed? He designed and executed the `Seven Countries` Study. (read more in the book)  

In [August 2017](https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/pdf/10.4103/ijmbs.ijmbs_71_17.pdf) [[2](https://thenoakesfoundation.org/ancel-keys-cholesterol-con-part-14-1994-2017/)] [[mirror](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/ykqknz3oy5xbhzxi0zi1i/Fat-heart-Disease-Hypothesis.pdf?rlkey=q3hlcmci2l033hmkn56f6ba0k&dl=1)], the results of the **Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology** (PURE) study were published. This seven-year study used modern methods and technology to examine the very same questions around dietary fat and disease that **Ancel Keys** looked at. But in marked contrast to the `Seven Countries` Study, the PURE study tracked 135,335 men and women across **eighteen** countries. So it was essentially a massively more dependable test of the fat theories. You might say it was a huge modern upgrade of a sloppy old study. So what did this PURE analysis conclude? It **came to the opposite conclusion** of Ancel Keys `Seven Countries` Study. PURE found that neither c**oronary heart disease** nor mortality in general were **associated** with intake of **overall fat or saturated fat**. In fact, higher saturated fat intake was **associated** with **benefits** such as **lower stroke rates**. However, **carbohydrate** did not fare so well: higher carbohydrate intake tracked with **increasing mortality**. Which was exactly what the **American Heart Association** `quietly` **acknowledged** in their **2015** report [Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics](https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000152), based on statistics relating to 344,696 men and women.  
  
## vegetable oils 

Natural saturated fat—the kind found in animal foods, nuts, olives, and other healthy whole foods (has been consumed by humans for millennia). It’s an excellent ingredient in a huge range of tasty foodstuffs. They would **gladly have used cheap refined polyunsaturated oils** (soybean and corn oils), among others (but polyunsaturated oils are unstable), which means they don’t have a long shelf life, and they don’t give foods the firm texture that their saturated cousins do. **Luckily** for industry, there was an available solution that **perfectly fit** the bill.

> Vegetable oils were **originally** used as machine lubricants. Then someone got the **bright idea** of feeding them to humans. Vegetable oils are toxic for people.

In the early **1900s**, the food industry figured out how to convert cottonseed oil into a stable semisolid product through a process known as **hydrogenation**. This was achieved in huge industrial chemical plants. The high temperatures, pressures, and solvents used made this "vegetable shortening" rather **toxic for humans**, but nobody realized this at the time. The tortured molecules delivered the required properties of solidity and shelf life. And it was filthy cheap to produce. That was all that mattered. And so, **since 1911**, we have been eating these **industrially synthesized saturated fats** known as **partially hydrogenated oils**. It turns out that hydrogenation creates molecules called **trans fats** that we now know are directly linked to c**oronary heart disease**. So, ironically, these products contributed to the **explosion** of **heart disease** for which `Ancel Keys` and his acolytes blamed **natural saturated fats**.

> **Trans fats** have finally been deemed unfit for human consumption. The restrictions took place in a series of actions from the early 2000s on around the world, starting with [Denmark](https://web.archive.org/web/20161217115302/https://www.foedevarestyrelsen.dk/english/Food/Trans%20fatty%20acids/Pages/default.aspx).  

The **combination** of **polyunsaturated oil** and **fructose**, however, was a `disaster`. And this nasty combination has gone through the roof in the **past century**. Most **processed foods** are **laden** with both polyunsaturated oils and sugar—modern `breads` alone are a perfect example of the problem. The industrial process that produces these polyunsaturated oils **causes the fats to become damaged** and essentially **unfit** for ``human consumption``.  

If you saw the **multistep industrial process** used to **create** these **oils**, you would not touch them. High temperatures, high pressures, petrochemical solvents, bleaching, and more! You can get an idea of the process by watching a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omjWmLG0EAs) on the FatHeadMovie channel,. Yet we are told to replace natural, genuinely healthy fats with these chemical compounds. `Remove polyunsaturated oils and processed foods from your diet`. You will get plenty of **polyunsaturated fats** from our healthy whole-foods diet plan. The best dietary strategies to achieve this are ones that minimize the consumption of 
* refined carbohydrates
* sugars
* vegetable oils  

Of course, once you eliminate these foods, you will need to replace these missing calories with **healthier alternatives**. And that is `where healthy fats come to the rescue`!  

Over evolutionary history, humans ingested very low levels of **polyunsaturated fats**. These fats are indeed essential for human health. But only very low intakes are required. We **now** consume maybe **twenty times** more than the base requirement for health.  
  
There are different types of **polyunsaturated fats**, but the main ones to note are the `omega-3 `and `omega-6` varieties. Excessive intake of **omega-6** fatty acids drives **inflammation**, and having the right ratio of omega-6 to omega-3—ideally, 1:1 to 3:1 is essential for good health.  

> The science suggests that **vegetable oils** are **contributing** the **vast majority** of the **omega-6 problem** in our world today. Vegetable oils are more fit for use in a **lawnmower** than in your body. Cold-pressed **olive oil, coconut oil**, and other natural oils are unquestionably the best choice.  

## announcements

In **1977**, `Dietary Goals` for the United States officially told us to jack up the percentage of **carbohydrate** in our diet to **55–60 percent** of our caloric intake. This gave the **food industry** the **opportunity** to provide a major new source of **processed carbohydrate**. The food industry released an enormous mushroom cloud of **refined wheat flour and sugar**, including the especially odious `high-fructose corn syrup`. And **without fat natural** satiating effects, **refined carbohydrates created a new era** of hunger (and a major business benefit to the `food corporations`). The **hunger** that these products **created** drove **food revenues** also. Another industry was also set for enormous revenue growth. The `pharmaceutical industry` massively exploited an explosion of `chronic disease` driven **by** the **new food supply**. `Two of the biggest industries in the world made out like bandits from the low-fat diet fad`. For we had unwittingly replaced an imaginary poison `natural fats` with very real ones 
* trans fats
* refined grains
* sugar  

However lacking in any robust science, the low-fat age began in earnest. `Nothing would ever be the same again`.

There actually were **good experiments**, proper randomized controlled trials—on dietary fat and heart disease in the **1960s** and **1970s**. These trials were all carried out on human subjects, so their results are particularly **important**. Sadly, they were **ignored**. The problem was that these experiments **showed** that **dietary fat** was **not significantly linked** to **heart disease**. These gold-standard experiments **disproved** the diet-heart **hypothesis**! The leaders who were pushing the **low-fat theory** did not like these **results**, so the experiments were **ignored**. (British researcher **Zoe Harcombe** published a paper in the esteemed **British Medical Journal** whose title says it all: [Evidence from Randomized Controlled Trials Did Not Support the Introduction of Dietary Fat Guidelines in 1977 and 1983](https://doi.org/10.1136/openhrt-2014-000196)) One notable trial in **1973** even had its results `withheld from publication`. Eventually, the study was [quietly published](https://doi.org/10.1161/01.atv.9.1.129) in a modest journal in **1989**, a full sixteen years after its analysis was completed. The results were not published for so long because, as recounted by the principal investigator of the experiment, Ivan D. Frantz Jr., `We were just so disappointed in the way they turned out`.

Between food-industry marketing and the steady drumbeat of media messages explaining that **red meat** and **eggs** are **deadly**, Americans have gotten the message, all right. Apparently around **36 percent** of Americans believe that **UFOs are real**, but only **25 percent believe** that there is **no link** between **natural fats and heart disease**.

You will have to **overcome** the powerful **dogma** that exalted the `complex carbohydrates` at the base of the **food pyramid**. You will have to remind yourself that these carbohydrates are mostly just **glucose** (sugar) with some nutrients and fiber —which are easy to get from far, far healthier foods. Do not underestimate the power of this `high-carb propaganda`. It is a psychological poison that you must clear from your subconscious—the `rock on which our modern disease epidemics have been built`.  

## the healthy way

What you **put in your mouth** sets off an explosive cascade of **hormonal signaling** throughout your body. The most trivial aspect of food is its calories. It is the type of food that is crucial to long-term weight-management success— as is the mixture of foods that make up your meals. What you eat **determines** how your body **produces hormones** that affect weight and health. Many hormones work together and respond dramatically to the types of food you eat. Here a short list of some major ones: 
* `Insulin` (master regulator of glucose and fat-burning) 
* `Glucagon` (controller of glucose release into your system, the yin to insulin yang)
* `Leptin` (released by your fat cells to regulate appetite and more) 
* `Ghrelin` (the hunger hormone, released by your empty stomach) 
* `GIP` (stimulated by carbohydrate, released by your gut to trigger insulin and prime fat cells for energy take-up)
* `GLP-1` (released in your gut to enhance the function of the pancreas, which makes insulin) 
* `PYY` (released in your gut to control appetite and enhance pancreatic function)

> Actually, it’s never okay to eat **bread**. The hamburger could be okay if eaten on its own. In fact, bread can cause the hamburger to become **problematic**. There is a synergy between macronutrients. The mixture matters.


Before you embark on our plan to lower your insulin, it is important to know where you are starting from. This is not difficult to find out. The simplest way is to calculate what’s called your HOMA value, which indicates your level of insulin resistance, using one of the many online [calculators](https://href.li/?http://www.thebloodcode.com/homa-ir-calculator). All you need for this is the measure of your fasting glucose and fasting insulin. These tests can be requested in any doctor’s office. If it is below 1.0, you have low insulin resistance. Between 1.0 and 1.5 is marginal and may require some corrective action. Approaching 2.0 and certainly above 2.0 indicates significant levels of insulin resistance.

For **weight loss** and longevity (by way of lower insulin status and insulin sensitivity) it is **important** to **burn fat** as your **primary fuel**, and that means significantly reducing the amount of **carb** you eat. Eating this way will also enable huge **improvements** in **appetite** control, since **fat** is so **satiating**.

> **fat-adapted**: after your body optimizes its fat-burning machinery and switches to preferring fat to glucose. This fat adaptation occurs in the first weeks.  

There are three main lower-carb approaches:  
* `Paleo`: medium carb, moderate to high protein, moderate fat
* `Low-carb, high-fat `([LCHF](https://href.li/?https://ketolibriyum.ca/blogs/ketolife-blog/lchf-vs-keto-the-run-down)): low carb, moderate protein, high fat
* `Keto`: very low carb, moderate protein, very high fat  

**Keto** is a special case of low-carb. Keto is short for ketogenic diet, so named because burning fat produces unique molecules called ketones, which are used for energy. On keto, the body enters a state of nutritional ketosis, in which it is **fueled by fat**. Keto is essentially a very low carb regimen, with a very high percentage of energy coming from **dietary fats** (or your own body fat). In the meantime, we’ll highlight that the keto macronutrient mix is approximately :  
* 70 percent or more fat
* 20 percent protein
* less than 10 percent carb  

a standard `low-carb` diet is approximately :  
* 60 percent fat
* 20 percent protein
* 20 percent carb  

For comparison, the traditional `Paleo` diet is generally :
* 50 percent fat
* 20 percent protein
* 30 percent carb  

Keto, is a more extreme version of [LCHF](https://imgur.com/a/iY9t28U) diet. `We personally (book authors) follow LCHF, but we regularly shift into keto for enhanced low-carb benefits`..  

> Millions of new fat-burning enzymes will be rapidly manufactured during this wonderful and miraculous transition.  

The **dietary requirement** for carbohydrate is effectively **zero** (humans do not need to consume any carbohydrate). Fat, on the other hand, is **essential** for health. The other essential macronutrient is **protein**. The average person must consume `60 to 100 grams of protein` a day. Eating too little protein has serious consequences for health and **vitality**.  

The ideal quantity varies for different people, but for everyone, we recommend looking at net carbs, not total carbs. The **net carb content** of a food is the **total carb** minus the grams of indigestible **fibrous carb**. See this [cheat sheet](https://href.li/?https://thefatemperor.com/carb-cheat-sheet/) [[mirror](https://imgur.com/a/F88EmLT)] for food carbs.  
  
We espouse the `40/80/120 rule` for carb intake :  
* If you have established **insulin resistance**, prediabetes (consistently high blood glucose), or type 2 diabetes, the net carb intake needs to be less than `40 grams` daily
* If you’re **insulin-sensitive**, your net carb intake should be around `80 grams` daily
* For the **vast majority** of people, net carb intake should never exceed `120 grams` per day  

**Eat only nutrient-dense** and slow-burning carbohydrates, which can promote gut and general health, and keep carb intake low. Your initial target should be approximately 15 to 20 percent of your total calories.  

**Eat nutrient-dense sources of protein**. Always consume highquality protein—make that protein count. Your target should be approximately 0.4 to 0.6 gram per pound of lean body mass if you are not athletic—more if you’re more active. Get most of your calories from fats that come from nutrient-rich foods. These fats should supply 60 to 65 percent of your total daily calories.  

**Eat only three main meals** a day—ideally two, if you can manage it. You can make this a wonderful habit for life. You will learn to relish each meal. Your body will positively hum with this regimen. Be mindful of your lifestyle and environment. Poor sleep, stress, and lack of healthy sun exposure will hammer your weight-loss efforts. Do not neglect these environmental influences. Partake in healthy exercise. `Resistance exercise is best`.  

Completely **eliminate bad processed food**. Let’s clarify what we mean by that. These foods include :  
* Most `breads`, which are made from finely ground grains, vegetable oils, added sugar, and many other bad things
* Most `packaged foods` cereals, soups, and so on—which contain powdered grains, vegetable oils, and sugars
* Nearly all `healthy snack bars`—they are normally made from powdered grains, **vegetable oils**, and sugars, and they are almost always **too sugary**  

> All these will **disrupt** your body **hormonal weight control system**, cause increased hunger, and trigger weight gain—along with health problems.  

The other part of this step is to **target the carbs** that can **help** you. These have **no refining** to make them dangerous, and they have plenty of **fiber** on board for **satiety and insulin moderation**. These are also the **carbs** that can **improve** your **gut microbiome**. A healthy gut microbiome in turn helps with many things, including **insulin sensitivity**. Focus on **nutrient-dense carb**s that are generally **slower** to digest. **Slow digesting carbs** do not **spike** blood sugar and insulin as much, and they stimulate hormones that **help pancreatic function** and moderate appetite. Center your carb allocation on above-ground **non-starchy vegetables**, like spinach, broccoli, and cauliflower. In moderation, some tubers like sweet potatoes can also be okay—**boiled** rather than baked lowers insulin response.  

High-fiber carbs provide material that can **promote** the growth of **beneficial bacteria** in your **gut microbiome**. Your microbiome can have a **large influence** on your **insulin sensitivity** and weight gain tendencies; some less-beneficial bacteria can directly trigger insulin and promote insulin resistance. For higher-carb treats, `dark chocolate `is a good bet—80 percent cacao or higher is ideal. If you are skipping a meal or feeling hunger pangs, dark chocolate hits the spot with **minimal damage**. It contains multiple antioxidant compounds and a range of important minerals, such as magnesium, manganese, and copper, and if it’s 80 percent cacao or more, the sugar content won’t be too high.   
  
`Protein` provides key **amino acids** your body needs. Consuming these wonderful molecules means that your body won’t trigger hunger in an attempt to pursue them. At the same time, we do not believe in consuming **excessive protein**, as high intakes can be converted into glucose, trigger inappropriate insulin release, and promote related growth pathways.  

A properly formulated **low-carb**, high-healthy-fat diet:  
* is hugely effective in resolving prediabetes and diabetes improves appetite control
* optimizes the absorption of vitamins A, D, E and K
* strengthens the immune system
* minimizes systemic inflammation
* enhances rapid recovery after sustained vigorous exercise
* lowers the important risk markers for heart disease
* slows aging and improves energy
* promotes healthy skin, hair, nails, and many other outward signs of health  

Consuming **tasty fat** with **plant** foods will enhance **nutrient transport** into your body. For this reason you should always **eat vegetables** and salads with some **olive oil** or grass-fed **butter**. `Coconut oil` is another excellent choice for this purpose (it has been found to **improve absorption** of antioxidants and other nutrients **even more** than other **fats**).  

From the other side on a `low-fat` diet, we can end up **deficient** in the **fat-soluble** vitamins, which are required for optimal health. The four important fat-soluble vitamins are A, D, E, and K. In order for your body to absorb these, they need to be consumed with plenty of fat. Being low in any of these contribute to a dizzying array of health issues. Another important point to note is that vitamins A, D, and K interact with each other to a great degree. They also interact synergistically with minerals, including magnesium and zinc.  

> We now have good evidence in model organisms...that if you **overfeed** someone with **fat**, you **do not** increase their cancer risk at all—good? You **overfeed** someone with **carbohydrates** and you **dramatically increase** their cancer risk. And protein is halfway in between. ([Dr. Craig B. Thompson](https://www.mskcc.org/about/leadership/office-president/craig-b-thompson-biography), the head of Memorial Sloan Kettering)  

As you **cross the bridge** to becoming a `fat-burner`, your body will be undergoing wonderful changes. But these changes will bring **new requirements** for particular nutrients, the most important minerals to pay attention to are :  
* sodium
* magnesium
* potassium  

> Start eating bacon, real butter, eggs, and many other /forbidden/ foods.  
>  
> Eat an avocado every day; eat more nuts, especially macadamias; and consume healthy fats, including coconut oil, olive oil, and butter. Later, she learned about adding more delicious fats and the wonderful health benefits of eliminating grains.
>
> Remember, Once the **junk** is ingested, many days of great achievement are **undone**.  

[Diet Doctor - low-carb meal ideas](https://href.li/?https://www.dietdoctor.com/)  

* Butter Cappuccino
* Three eggs, any style, with 2 slices cooked bacon
* Three-egg omelet filled with 60 g fresh (soft) goat cheese 
* Two hard-boiled eggs with 60 g full-fat cheese  

Here are the ones we recommend for emergencies.  
If **no refrigeration** is available:  
* Dark chocolate (80 to 85 percent cacao or greater)
* Nuts (macadamia nuts, Brazil nuts, hazelnuts, pistachios, walnuts,pecans, etc.)
* Canned fish (tuna, sardines, etc.)
* High-quality cured meats or dry sausage without grains or added oils  

If **refrigeration** is available:  
* Bone broth (and other low-carb, low-calorie broths)
* Cheeses (whatever full-fat variety is your favorite)
* Mix of olives, feta cheese, and lardons  

Checking your post-meal blood glucose, keep an eye on your fasting glucose—your blood glucose level first thing in the morning, following an overnight fast. It should generally be below 100 mg/dL. Repeated readings above this indicate a problem, and at that point you should ask your doctor to test your fasting insulin to see if there is a genuine problem afoot.You can use a blood glucose meter to check your post-meal glucose. The price of these meters has plummeted in recent years due to the exploding diabetes epidemic. Get yourself a dependable model and a pack of disposable test strips. We use the Freestyle Optium from Abbott, which has the added advantage of measuring ketone levels, too. (You’ll remember that ketones are produced when your body burns fat, so measuring your ketone levels is a good way to find out if your body has become a fat-burner). Occasionally check your blood glucose before and approximately one hour after a meal. If your blood glucose increases by more than 30 mg/dL after a meal, you’ll know that something you ate is a problem for you. Some people have problems with dairy. Others are sensitive to certain meats or a higher protein intake. A blood glucose meter gives you instant feedback on what to avoid in the future.  

To find out in time that you are heading for the rocks, you need to focus on your insulin signaling. It will tell you when the problem starts.  

Achieve low insulin.  
  
Here are the tests we would recommend, should you be willing to get them:  
* Fasting blood glucose and fasting insulin
* A1C (average blood glucose over several months)
* Standard lipid panel (triglyceride, total cholesterol, HDL, and LDL)
* Vitamin D levels (the detailed name is the 25(OH)D test)
* Liver panel with GGT, AST, and ALT. When the levels of these liver enzymes are high, it indicates inflammation—low levels of GGT, in particular, are very important.
* Serum ferritin (iron loading in the blood) and homocystein levels (a significant heart disease risk factor when high indicates low Bvitamin intake and other issues)
* `[advanced]` Oral glucose tolerance test with insulin assay (or simply a two-hour
post-glucose insulin, which gives similar information but is much
easier to acquire)
* `[advanced]` Advanced lipoprotein profile with ApoB, ApoA1, and sdLDL.
These measure the number and size of your cholesterol-carrying
particles  

> Having both low HDL and high triglycerides indicates that unhealthy hormonal signaling is afoot.  

Recommended supplements for fat-burner :  
* Potassium
* Sodium
* Magnesium
* Omega-3 fatty acids
* Vitamin D
* Iodine  

**Iodine deficiency** and associated **thyroid function** issues are also intimately connected to triglyceride and cholesterol problems (found supplement with 500–1000 mcg per day). [reference](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/iodine/)  

Iodine is a vital nutrient that is crucial for **fetal development** and during early childhood. But it is also hugely important to get adequate iodine **all** throughout life. It is required for **proper thyroid function** and much else. The effects of a low dietary intake of iodine are stark. Symptoms can **include** difficulty losing weight, muscle weakness, lethargy, memory problems, high triglycerides and other cholesterol imbalances, and poor resistance to infections and the list goes on and on.  

Start taking an **omega-3 fish oil**, you will **eliminate** the dreadful omega-6-filled vegetable oils from your diet, so you will be well on your way to fixing your ratio of omega-6 to omega-3.  

Likewise, your body’s stores of glycogen (glucose) finally have begun to deplete. Glycogen carries a lot of water, so you’ll have experienced weight loss due to this factor alone as your body drops water weight.  
  
The fall in insulin is also opening the door to your new fat-burning physiology. You are getting most of your energy from healthy fats now. Your body is beginning to switch over its machinery to burn this fat more efficiently. Your insulin and glucose levels have begun to drop, particularly your post-meal levels. Likewise, the most important cholesterol numbers have started to improve.  
  
After some level of fat-adaptation is achieved, you can deploy meal spacing as a powerful intervention. Make this a primary goal over the coming fourteen days!  

The human body is an enormously **complex machine**. Every moment of every day, billions of **biochemical reactions** are underway. These reactions require many different vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients. A healthy diet **will supply** most of these nutrients, and we strongly recommend that you target foods that can supply all your nutrient needs.  

Further complicating the issue is the **fact** that supplements do **not** have to be **evaluated** and approved by the FDA, so they **can be sold without proof** of effectiveness or safety.  

It is important to note that `vitamin D` has many key **interactions** with the other fat-soluble vitamins, **A and K2** in particular. Therefore, it is not necessarily a good idea to **drive up your D** status while **neglecting the others**. These fat-soluble vitamins **as a group also interact synergistically** with **minerals** such as magnesium and zinc. The ideal strategy is to ensure that you are getting adequate amounts of **all the key vitamins and minerals**.  

Adequate `magnesium` is **hugely important** for a properly functioning body and is arguably one of the most important nutrients to focus on for health and longevity. But our health system **largely ignores** it. One major issue is that the **blood test** for magnesium is a **very weak indicator** of your **true magnesium status**. Even if you are terribly **deficient**, it can come back as 'within the normal range'. Here’s why: 

> Less than 1 percent of the body magnesium is carried in the bloodstream (most is sequestered in bone and other tissues).  

If you’re low in available magnesium, your body **will leach it out of your bones** to supply your needs. This will make the blood level appear **to be okay**, even when a desperate situation is occurring out of sight. Your level of free cellular magnesium is the most important measure, but this is not assessed in standard blood tests. **Low magnesium** links to **nearly all** known cardiovascular risk factors. It is estimated that **70 to 80 percent** of adults are **not achieving** dietary requirements of magnesium. Because of the blood test **inadequacy**, it is hard to estimate what proportion is truly low.  

* `K1` is linked mostly to clotting processes, `K2` has a unique range of important functions. K1 is important, and we certainly recommend getting plenty of it from green leafy vegetables, spring onions, broccoli etc. Of particular interest is its contribution to preventing calcification of the blood vessels and other soft tissues.  
* `K2` activates what are called **GLA proteins**, which **inhibit** inappropriate soft-tissue calcification. This means that K2 plays an important role in **keeping calcium away** from tissues where it could be problematic (arterial walls, for example).  It acts **synergistically** with `vitamins A and D`: in essence, it enables many reactions that **allow A and D to provide their benefits** to the human body. `K2` is particularly connected to processes that distribute calcium to the parts of the body that require it (primarily bones and teeth).  
* `Vitamin A` Required particularly to interact with vitamin D, as the two vitamins are very connected in their bodily functionsthe (the ratio of D and A is important to keep in balance).. Retinol is the ideal form of vitamin A. Cod liver oil is a super supplemental source of retinol.  
* `Vitamin E` There are actually a **range** of vitamins under the `E` heading. The E vitamins are carried around the body by the **lipoproteins** and they are important for **antioxidant** effects.  
* `B vitamins` The B-complex vitamins comprise vitamin B12, vitamin B6, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, folate, pantothenic acid, and biotin. These all have important biological functions, in particular, they **help your body turn food into energy**.  
* `Vitamin C` helping to **repair and regenerate tissues**, protecting against heart disease, preventing scurvy, and assisting in lipid or cholesterol metabolism.  
* `Zinc and copper` It is key to have an adequate zinc intake. One reason is that **zinc interacts with magnesium and the fat-soluble** vitamins, helping the latter to **function optimally**. being **very high in zinc** may not be so good if you are very low on copper and vice versa. The **ratios are important**, rather than individual intakes.  
* `Selenium` is required for proper functioning of the **thyroid gland** and many other functions.  
* `Potassium` It is key to have an adequate potassium intake, **particularly on a low-carb** diet. **Avocados** are especially rich in potassium and also contain plenty of healthy **fat**, making them a great choice.  
* `Sodium` It is key to have an adequate sodium intake. It is far **more likely** that your salt **intake** is **too low** rather than too high. [The Salt Fix](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GBAJR9C)  
* `Chromium` is a metallic element that we require in **small** amounts. It is an **essential part** of metabolic processes that **regulate** blood sugar, and it assists in the many actions of insulin.  
* `Berberine` exists purely as a supplement. It is extracted from certain types of plants (for example, barberry, Oregon grape, and goldenseal). Many published studies have shown it to be a moderately **helpful treatment** for type **2 diabetes** and metabolic syndrome. Its beneficial effects can include **reducing blood glucose and triglycerides**, and **improving LDL** particle quality.  

Simple blood test called the **omega-3 index** tells you the amount of omega-3 in your **cells**, based on the ratios of **omega-6** to omega-3 in the **membranes** of your **red blood** cells. In **Japan**, the population omega-3 index is generally around `8 to 11` percent (currently accepted as **optimal**). **Below 8 percent** is increasingly being seen as problematic. **Northern Europeans** vary greatly around the `6` percent level. Unsurprisingly, **US citizens** average around `4` percent. This is acknowledged to be a really bad level. Of course, the US is swimming in vegetable oils.  


## fasting 
**Frequent eating** will maintain the fed state and hamper your progression to a fat-burning mode, and eating many calorie-restricted meals with high carb content is not sustainable for most. Hunger will eventually cause you to fail.  

> Eating too often while also attempting to reduce your calories is a fool’s game.  
  
**Fasting** creates a heightened sense of awareness and sharpened frame of mind. Therefore we make a point of not eating in the first part of the day before the event. We go in fasted and thus achieve peak performance. Of course, we gain this edge only because we are fat-adapted—our bodies have their fat-burning machinery in place so we can burn our own body fat smoothly, just as our ancestors could. It would not work so well for a sugar-burner, who would just slump after a few hours without a carb fix. Fasting gives you an edge if you are a capable fat-burner. It is an edge that you will grow to desire and even depend on. And you will be honing your health as you use this advantage.  
  
Simply to drop one meal on a couple of days each week. It is important to enjoy your two meals as normal, eating until you’re satisfied. In fact, you should relish them—the eating experience will now be enhanced. To keep it simple, there are two primary approaches to meal spacing— either skip breakfast or skip lunch. We prefer to skip breakfast. We have, at most, a coffee with a couple of tablespoons of heavy cream instead.  
  
After hours without food, the body **exhausts its sugar stores** and starts burning **fat**. He refers to this as [metabolic switching](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/intermittent-fasting-what-is-it-and-how-does-it-work).  

One of the most important benefits of a low-carb, high-healthy-fat diet is an indirect one: **it enables much better control of your appetite**. This means that it greatly enables you to habitually space out your meals, in other words, it helps you `incorporate fasting` into your **daily life**.  

`Fasting` encourages **mental clarity** and **enhances the thought** processes. They may also have had an inkling that fasting in a sense cleanses the body. Hippocrates, Paracelsus, and Galen, the three fathers of modern medicine, all believed `fasting` to be a powerful **medical intervention**.  

The health benefits of `fasting` have been recognized increasingly in the past decades, particularly among medical researchers. Studies have shown that fasting:  
* promotes `insulin sensitivity` in all people
* reduces `insulin resistance` in people with prediabetes
* reduces `inflammation`
* helps **reverse** type `2 diabetes`
* reduces `blood pressure`
* improves the health of `fat cells` and improves fat-burning
* improves `weight loss` while retaining muscle better than calorie restriction
* improves `mood and mental` clarity
* enhances `autophagy` (cellular regeneration and repair)
* protects against damage from `radiation` in cancer patients
* promotes `longevity`  

> We simply **skip meals** occasionally because our low-carb diet has turned us into excellent fat-burners. If it is easy to do something that is very good for you, then why not do it?  

**Deep ketosis** is a state in which your body use of **glucose is minimal** and your **ketone levels** are very high. Your body is producing and utilizing a high level of `ketones` for **fuel**. Ketosis is a **metabolic state** in which your body **primarily burns** fat for energy (instead of carbohydrates) indicating a **significant shift** in your **body energy source**. It can be highly **therapeutic** in the treatment of many diseases, including epilepsy and obesity. **Most people** already live somewhere on a `keto spectrum`, which goes from the **heavy glucose-burner** (very low ketone use) on one end all the way to super fat-burner (very high ketone use) on the other end. You can choose where on this spectrum you want to be. We find it (book authors) best to **live** in the **mild ketosis** end of the spectrum. We do, however, move in and out of **deep ketosis** regularly through a combination of food choice and fasting strategies. This way, we intermittently receive the extra benefits of fasting, including enhanced **mental acuity** and **autophagy** (the breaking down of unhealthy old cells and creation of healthy new ones).

> Remember that a *high-carb* diet **pumps glucose** into your body. With a lot of glucose available, there will be no fat-burning or keto action in sight.

If you greatly reduce your carbohydrate intake, however, your body starts getting **ready to move along the keto spectrum**. This way of eating, **depletes your glycogen stores** quite quickly, and as those stores **fall**, your body **begins** to produce increasing levels of `ketones` to meet your energy requirements. It also begins to fabricate a small, **steady stream** of glucose for the **few** tissues that need it (**most tissues** can **run** on **fat** and ketones alone). This process of **creating glucose from stored fat and protein** is called `gluconeogenesis`. Your body can create this required glucose with ease. Your **liver** could pump out many times the level required. Glucose is easy to make out of fat and protein stores (it’s having too much glucose that is the common problem!).  

As you go deeper into ketosis, your body **increasingly switches** to relying on nonglucose fuel sources. Fat is burned **directly** by many **tissues** while ketones supply the rest. In this state, the brain use of **glucose drops** from 100 percent to as low as 30 percent (with those crucial ketones providing the remaining 70 percent).  

It is important to ensure that most of your **fat calories** come from **saturated** or **monounsaturated** fat (or, indeed, your own body fat). Be careful **not to overeat polyunsaturated fats**. Eating high quantities of polyunsaturated fat actually works **against** many of the benefits of **keto**.

If your (blood) ketone level is 
* above 0.5 mmol/L, you’re in a state of nutritional ketosis
* a level of 2–4 mmol/L means you’re in deep ketosis  

You can use a **blood ketone meter** to test the ketones. There is also **Ketonix system**, which measures ketones from the **breath**, with no blood sample required, it is also arguably **more accurate**, since the ketones on the breath reflect what you are actually producing, whereas the ketones in your blood may appear low because you are constantly burning them up to fuel your body.  

## protein
Proteins are **complex molecules** made up of `amino acids`. Amino acids are **fundamental** for life (they make up our very DNA). Some amino acids **can be produced** by the body. Others must be **acquired** through our diet. The `nine amino acids` that we **must** get from **food** are called **essential amino acids**.  

Amino acids can be linked to **form long** protein chains. These chains can be folded into complex shapes, which give the proteins new and powerful properties. That is where the **magic** of amino acids plays out, they enable **endless possible proteins** for **myriad crucial functions**. Proteins also enable you to **create enzymes**, which are themselves **clever proteins** that can catalyze other necessary processes. Proteins conduct the **billions** of processes your body requires. Proteins are used to create all your **crucial hormones** and signaling molecules. Finally, proteins directly supply the **main building blocks for your body tissues**. When we ingest food, the proteins in it are **broken down** into amino acids. We gather up these amino acids and **reuse** them. This is **especially** true for the **nine essential amino acids**.  

The researchers concluded that the **higher-protein** diet not only suppressed appetite but also led to the improved feelings of **fullness** gained through the strategy of eating **fewer meals**. Science has shown that if you **don’t eat enough protein**, you will **continue** to eat until you get it. The body **has important requirements** for protein, so our brains **appetite-control systems** are wired to **drive us** to get enough. Higher protein in the diet activates **hunger-suppressing hormones**, including peptide YY, GLP-1, and others.  

Here is a **slight drawback** to a **high-protein** diet: while **it is not nearly as bad as carb**, protein still **drives** an `insulin response`. If you are eating a **lot** of protein, the **insulin release can be substantial**. This is why our low-carb, high-fat plan **recommends that you consume moderate amounts of protein**. Protein generally **produces around half of the insulin response** that the **same amount of carb does**, and **it has** an even smaller relative effect on blood **glucose**, which rises very little and tapers off steadily.  

Because **protein** takes a relatively **long time to digest**, insulin stays **elevated** for many hours, and this, of course, is not ideal. Muscle and other tissues are also **constantly being recycled**. This **releases amino acids** into the blood, increasing the **pool** of available protein. If you’re losing weight, the breakdown of excess **skin** and **other** tissue can supply a source of protein **on top** of what you’re eating, and this can contribute to an **excess of protein** at any time.  

Much of what happens when we eat **protein or carb** reflects the **balance** between the hormones **insulin** and **glucagon**. Insulin and glucagon are **opposing forces**. At its simplest, **insulin drives fat storage and promotes tissue growth** (its `anabolic` or building function). **Glucagon**, on the other hand, **promotes the release of fatty acids** from **adipose tissue** and the release of **glucose** from glycogen (in the absence of food, these are used for energy). In the fed state, insulin is generally high and glucagon is rightly suppressed. The **opposite occurs in the fasted state**, with glucagon **going high to free up** energy from fat or other sources.  

**High-carb** meals drive **insulin high**, keeping **glucagon low**. Protein **drives insulin also**, to help build muscle from the **ingested** protein. But it also stimulates the release of glucagon, that way, the drop in blood glucose insulin causes is balanced by glucose (and fatty acids) coming into the bloodstream from storage, so overall, **blood sugar stays stable**. But when someone who is `insulin resistant` eats a **lot of protein** with **lot of carb**, this balancing act is **tricky to achieve**, and this leads to an **unstable hormonal situation** and **unpredictable blood sugar levels**. This kind of situation should of course be avoided, we must always strive for low and stable blood sugar and insulin levels.  

This is why our plan centers on **low carbohydrate** and **moderate protei**n. If you are keeping carb in a healthy low range, then **there is room for a higher amount of protein**, since **both** stimulate insulin. Eating a **higher amount of healthy fat** provides energy without **provoking insulin** or a rise in blood glucose, and this combination is **optimal** for most people. Whether you are losing weight or maintaining your weight, whether you are insulin sensitive or insulin resistant, this combination of low carb, moderate protein, and high fat **should fit**. The goal should always be to keep insulin low. And generally this means high glucagon, **insofar** as it is possible.  




## exercise
**Sleep cycle** and quality. Achieving quality sleep is very important. Ideally, you should be getting at least seven hours of quality sleep per night. Countless people have undermined their weight-loss plans through poor sleep hygiene.  
  
**Stress management**. Chronic stress makes weight loss much harder to achieve and sustain. It also significantly undermines long-term health.  
  
**Sunlight exposure.** But you will benefit hugely from accessing good natural light for at least thirty minutes in the morning after awakening— not through windows but out in the fresh air.  

**Exercise** can contribute in many ways to your fat-burning capabilities. It has all the following benefits:  
* Depletes the body’s glycogen stores and lowers blood glucose
* Lowers insulin levels and enhances insulin sensitivity
* Enhances the fat-burning machinery of muscles via mitochondrial changes
* Liberates fatty acids from adipose tissue so they can be burned as fuel
* Encourages cells to renew themselves  

Long, brisk walks in the fresh air are the easiest option for many people. The best exercise for enhancing muscle function and insulin sensitivity, though, is resistance training, sometimes called weight training. This does not mean you need to use expensive equipment or join a gym just do basic strength training at home using, at most, a pull-up bar and some dumbbells.  

Virtual jump-rope (5 minutes)—you can use an actual rope, but you don’t really need one :  
* Push-ups
* Sit-ups
* Chin-ups (using a basic pull-up bar attached to a doorway)
* Wall squats (squat down with your back lightly pressed against a wall, rise to standing, repeat)  

The **key** for each exercise type is to continue it until you **cannot manage another repeation**. You only have to do this simple routine a few times a week to accrue truly **amazing benefits**.  
  
You will gain the greatest benefits by exercising **in a fasted state** (long after a meal). We find that a great time is just before you sit down to your evening meal.  
  
If you are up for the aerobics, we favor relatively short **jogging** sessions of twenty to thirty minutes.  
  
**Interval training**, this just means that at regular intervals during your jog, you break into a short, **hard sprint** of around 92 meters. Doing these sprints every **three minutes** or so will enhance the value of your routine.  
  
Try the routine of [MD pal Ted Naiman - BurnFatNotSugar](https://href.li/?https://tednaiman.com/) we think this is an absolutely super approach, takes only fifteen to twenty minutes.  
  
> We humans now have trillions of these mitochondria in our bodies. Without them and their fat burning ability, we would cease to exist.  
  
> It is not your body weight that dictates your fate. Your health depends on the health of your fat tissue, not the quantity of it.  

**Insulin sensitivity starts with cells**: just like the body as **a whole**, individual cells can be insulin resistant or insulin sensitive. Many people can have a lot of fat tissue whose cells are in a healthy, insulin-sensitive state. These people are referred to as `metabolically healthy obese`. They can remain insulin sensitive throughout their bodies, and they have relatively low risk for disease. Conversely, there are countless people who appear slim but whose fat tissue is unhealthy, insulin resistant and inflamed. This leads to wholebody insulin resistance. These people are referred to as `metabolically unhealthy normal weight` or `thin outside, fat inside` Your whole-body insulin sensitivity depends hugely upon the health and sensitivity of your fat tissue.  

## cholesterol

Everyone has heard of **cholesterol**, but what really is it? Cholesterol is a waxy molecule **essential** for life. So important, in fact, that virtually **every cell** can make it. It is the main structural component for **all the cells** and tissues in the human body. Without it, the body would, will eventually disappear. It plays a **major** role in bone building, is the main building block for **adrenal** and reproductive **hormones**, and is needed to synthesize the **bile salts** required for **proper digestion**, and the **brain** and **nervous** system are both **highly dependent** upon it for optimal function. Because it is necessary for life, the body itself **manufactures around 80–85 percent** of the cholesterol it requires, with the other **15–20 percent coming from the diet**.  
  
> The focus on cholesterol has been a weapon of **mass distraction** from the real cause of coronary artery disease (CAD) for more than fifty years.  
  
The increase in **triglycerides** and **cholesterol** leads directly to lower levels of HDL—one of the MIRS criteria. It also leads to increased levels of small and dense or `oxidized LDL`. While `normal LDL` may not present a problem, these forms of **modified LDL** can do so, leading to an `increased risk of heart disease`.  

The phenomenal human **brain** contains around **30 percent** of the **body cholesterol**, even though the brain is only around 4 percent of our body weight. It is required for much more besides. **Without** cholesterol there would be **no life**.  

Cholesterol is **required** for life on this planet. It comes from the sterol family of molecules, which are fat-like in nature. The cholesterol molecule enables the structure of c**ell walls**. It is a **vital building block** for many **hormones** that are central in the control systems of our bodies. Cholesterol is a **key part** of the **immune system** and is central to the body tissue **repair apparatus**. Without cholesterol there would be **no life**.

You may rightly wonder **how** this fundamental requirement for health became something that scientists **claimed**, `was somehow conspiring to kill us`. Evolution is not an idiot. It’s **not** the cholesterol that is the problem but rather the system that manages it in the body, which can become **dysfunctional**. This is why cholesterol **measures** can **correlate** loosely with **disease**.  

We have around `forty trillion cells` in our bodies, so you have forty trillion reasons to be **glad** of cholesterol. With some exceptions, all of these cells are blessed with the ability to **manufacture** their **own** cholesterol. Cholesterol is that critical. Cholesterol is **arguably** the most important substance that evolution has designed to **keep** you healthy.  

Cholesterol cannot **travel** around the bloodstream by **itself**, so nature has evolved some very special `boats` that **carry cholesterol molecules** safe inside them. These are **lipoprotein particles**. These boats need to clearly identify themselves in order to `dock` properly in many different **harbors**. They do this by **signaling** with a u**nique protein molecule** wrapped around their **outer shell**: an `apolipoprotein`. There is also **another** pivotal molecule that **travels** with cholesterol inside, these lipoprotein particles: `triglyceride`. These triglyceride molecules can be **consumed** through fat-containing food. They can also be **created** in your **liver**. Your body `assembles, disassembles, and transports` triglyceride to **fuel** your body. If triglyceride level in your blood is **higher** than it should be. **Excess fat** in your blood is a **major issue**. (read more in the book on WELCOME TO LIPOPROTEIN LAND | LDL FOR ENERGY AND CHOLESTEROL TRAFFICKING chapters).  

> **HDL** is directly correlated with insulin resistance.  

> **VLDL**: Very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) is the **mother** of LDL (it’s where LDL originates).  

Now we’ll reveal how these lipoproteins play in your **bodily orchestra**. Most importantly, we will explain how to avoid destroying their evolutionary function.  

The `VLDL` particle is created by the **liver**. Its cargo hold is packed with **fatty goods** to meet the **body needs**. VLDL must `dock` with muscle and/or fat tissue before releasing its goods. After **giving** up its **triglyceride cargo**, the VLDL particle **shrinks** and **transforms** into an **LDL particle**. In spite of LDL fearsome reputation, there is nothing bad happening here at all. Evolution has given us LDL for a **purpose**. It works fine if you eat the `kind of diet` humans evolved eating, **high in fat** and **low in carb**. But for the majority of people, especially as they get **older**, a high-carb diet tends to make VLDL particles **large** and **triglyceride-rich**. This is universally **bad news**. Large, triglyceride-rich VLDLs turn into **smaller** and **denser LDLs** that carry **less cholesterol**. With **less cholesterol** carried per particle, you **need more LDL particles** in circulation. With more LDL particles in circulation, more particles are exposed to **oxidative damage**. Also, such dysfunctional systems damage the **endothelium** (the artery inner surface) and this can certainly **cause LDL** to be a **problem**, too.  

Ironically, breaking the rules of a healthy diet not only means more particles are there to be exposed to damage, but it also damages **LDL particles itself**. Damaged LDLs don’t get taken up **properly** by your **liver**; instead, your **immune system** has the t**hankless task** of **trying** to **mop** them up. That means they **hang around** for **longer** in your blood (approximately **four days** rather than the ideal **two days**). You are now really **playing** with **fire**. These damaged particles are a **different breed** of **LDL** that may not like going **back** to the **liver**. But there is a place where these **problematic particles will end up**: inside your **inflamed arterial walls**. This is what **ultimately leads** to arterial plaque, blockages, and, eventually, heart attacks.  

`HDL` is more than just **good cholesterol**. It is something of a miracle worker. It plays multiple instruments in the **lipoprotein orchestra**. HDL starts off as a simple **protein**. It then **swells** as cholesterol and **triglyceride** are added to it. Armed and ready, it **carries** out its many crucial functions:  
* **swapping** cholesterol and triglyceride molecules in and out of VLDL and LDL particles to **balance** the system
* **extracting excess** triglyceride from VLDL and LDL particles to **prevent** them from becoming dysfunctional
* **collecting** cholesterol molecules from cells where there is an **excess**
* **delivering** cholesterol to the rare types of cells that can’t make their own
* **supplying** the gonads and adrenal glands with cholesterol, which is needed to synthesize important hormones
* **carrying** antioxidant artillery to protect the LDL lipoproteins from damage
* **removing** cholesterol from places where it ought not be (like arterial walls)  

Losing your **HDL functionality** will cost you **dearly**. But it is **happening all the time**, to hundreds of millions of people around the world who are **destroying** their HDL through what they **put** in their **mouths**. A **low HDL** value is a serious **problem**. What is the best way to keep your HDL level high and healthy? You need to keep both your **insulin** and your insulin resistance **low**.  

If your **LDL value** is well `above 200 mg/dL`, it is more likely to have some meaning—that fairly high, and it can **indicate** that your blood is **full of damaged LDL particles** that contribute to **arterial inflammation**.  But you must examine all the other values we’ve discussed (including HDL, triglyceride, insulin, and blood glucose) to make a call.  

People with the most serious issues can **often** have a **lower LDL** than healthy people, **especially** as they get closer to a **heart attack**. These unhealthy people have **insulin-resistance** problems, which means they have e**xcessive triglyceride** in their **lipoproteins**, which **crowds out cholesterol**. So these unfortunate people end up with a lower LDL value in the test, **even** though they are on **fire** inside. Also, their **HDL** desperately **tries** to remove the **excess triglyceride** and becomes poisoned with it, driving **down** their HDL levels.  

`Low HDL` consistently highlights genuinely problematic mechanisms in your body. It is a genuinely valuable flag that relates directly to the true root causes of disease.  Is a risk if the HDL value is `below 40 mg/dL` for men or 50 mg/dL for women.  

You can have a `high HDL` and still have some disease risk, HDL functionality can be problematic even when the HDL level appears good. That is why it is very important to look at `ratios`.  

Your **triglyceride number** also has utility in assessing risk. Triglyceride is most **useful** as an **indicator** of `insulin-signaling status`. High triglyceride **indicates** that high **insulin** and insulin resistance are **disrupting** your system. Many guidelines suggest that triglyceride should be `below 150 mg/dL`, and this is fair. From extensive research, however, we would say that an **ideal level** would be `below 100 mg/dL`. . If it’s below 100 mg/dL, however, it is highly likely that your **insulin signaling** is in a reasonably **good** state. If it’s `above 200 mg/dL`, your insulin signaling is pretty certain to be **impaired**.  

> **A high triglyceride value** means that your LDL-class particles are carrying a **heavier** load than they’re **designed** to. As HDL attempts to **manage** this **overload**, the HDL value will be **driven lower**.  

Cholesterol ratios reign **supreme** in assessing real **risk**. You can easily **calculate** the crucial cholesterol ratios from the numbers on standard cholesterol tests. These ratios are a **true indicator** of `metabolic health`. They truly show how well your `cholesterol transport system` is functioning and genuinely reflect the underlying causes of **vascular disease**.  

When you have pushed your insulin signaling into a bad place, triglyceride levels tend to increase and HDL simultaneously drops.   

`trig/HDL` predicts `atherosclerosis` (whereas LDL completely fails to do so). You can find your trig/HDL ratio (calculate your AIP). Once you know your triglycerides and HDL numbers, you can plug them
into an online [calculator](https://href.li/?http://www.biomed.cas.cz/fgu/aip/calculator.php) to find your **AIP**.  

The ratio of **total cholesterol** to **HDL** (total/HDL) is as easy to calculate as it is to address, and it speaks volumes. People who have significant **insulin resistance** often have a “normal” LDL. But they also have **low HDL** and **high triglycerides**. The triglyceride value jacks up the total cholesterol number, which means that the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL also gets jacked up. In this way, the `total/HDL` ratio is closely related to the `trig/HDL` ratio and has similar **usefulness**.  

The `total/HDL` ratio cuts a swath through all the noise. It doesn’t even require any exotic laboratory tests. So go ahead and calculate your ratio—the current guideline suggests you should be `lower than 5` or even `4.5`. Achieving `lower than 4` would be the **ideal target**. if your total cholesterol is 200 mg/dL (5.2 mmol/L) and your HDL is 50 mg/dL (1.3 mmol/L), your ratio would be 4-to-1. **Higher ratios** mean a higher risk of **heart disease**.  

Decrease your LDL without undermining a healthy low-carb, high-fat diet:
* Consume more **plant-based fats** from avocados, olive oil, and nuts.
* Replace some of your saturated fat intake with monounsaturated fats, without changing your overall fat intake.
* Reduce the **animal-based protein** in your diet (but keep in mind that protein is important).
* Reduce your consumption of **cheese**, especially if you’re eating a lot of it.
* Introduce **slightly more carbohydrates**—but only the **high-fiber**, nutrient-dense, slow-digesting kind.
* Increase your intake of **fish oil**, cod liver oil, or other healthy sources of **omega-3**.
* Get more healthy **sun** exposure if possible.
* Do more **resistance exercise**.  

**Losing weight** can cause **LDL to increase**, it is best to reach a stable weight and then establish a new baseline LDL level. Choosing real food over junk carbs and fake fat—it just feels so good. May you and your family eat rich and live long!  

We all **fear** heart attacks, we **worry** that they can just happen like **out of blue**. But this is a lie. There is **nothing sudden** about the **inflammatory disease** sequence leading to that `sudden` heart attack. **Most** heart attacks are caused by **atherosclerosis**, the inflammation of the arterial walls. There is a simple **five-minute scan** that can identify heart disease and how bad it is: the `coronary artery calcium (CAC) scan`.

Here’s a summary of the valuable measures that can be gleaned from the standard cholesterol tests.  
* **Triglyceride** should be safely below 80 to 100 mg/dL.
* **HDL** should be safely above 40 mg/dL (for men) or 50 mg/dL (for women).
* The ratio of **total cholesterol** to HDL is crucial and should be below 4.5, preferably below 4.
* The ratio of **triglyceride** to HDL is also crucial and should be well below 2, preferably around 1.
* A **CAC scan** will enable you to discover hidden heart disease where the risk factors can fail. Crucially, you can take action and check back later to verify that you have stopped the progression of atherosclerosis.

*transcript of TEDxPortland*  

That **works** on this system in **therapeutic** and **healing** ways, you're wondering now `What is wrong with that?`  

Alright, well, the answer lies within the annals of **American medical f_cking history**, starting (**1910**) with two guys [@Carneg1e @R0ckefeller](https://i.imgur.com/Yxo2xkS.png) who really wanted to `sell` a lot of prescription drugs. And in their `heyday` at the turn of the **20th century**, American medicine was based on **homeopathy** and **herbal** medicine, and **naturopaths** and **chiropractors** weren't `getting down` with patent **drugs**. So with the `millions of dollars` in their **pocketbook**, a document called the [Flexner Report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexner_Report) and the **full force** of state governments, American medical training was **consolidated** and **standardized** in accordance with **pharmaceutical drug science** to the **exclusion** of holistic care practices, **natural** substances and remedies and natural cures. And this **created** a **system** that made **patentable pharmaceutical drugs** that treated symptoms `easy to sell`, and that made natural holistic care and practices and unpatentable plant medicine like cannabis fringe, quackery and `illegal`. What's surprising the most is that US physicians prescribed cannabis routinely to their patients well into the **20th century**.  

Cannabis was **once a top** three most commonly prescribed **medicines**, dwindling out of use due to heavy taxation, the **prosecution** of the **doctors** who prescribed it, and, finally, it being w**ritten out** of the **American pharmacopeia in 1942**.  

> You see, big business wrote my textbook.  

And I can only speculate that the `endocannabinoid` system **was kept secret** for so long because its science **validated** the use of **unpatentable plant medicine**, like cannabis and other natural practices. But the **pharmaceutical industry** wasn't the only big business **disrupting** the once-free market of health. We humans spend multiples of **billions** of dollars annually on **unhealthy** and **low quality foods** in addition to the **prescription drugs** we reflexively **depend** upon, both of which are directly linked to endocannabinoid system **dysfunction**, which we now know is the **precipitant** to most **chronic diseases**. And as a result, humans are **getting sicker** and sicker, riding around and round on a Ferris `wheel of big interests` that we pay to ride.  

> That doesn't make any sense.  
> 
> We're **outsourcing** the responsibility of our health to the **bigs**, and they're cashing in at our expense.  

Staying on this ride is a **losing battle**. But this can be the past ... if we reimagine our future.

The endocannabinoid system (ECS) has a **connection** to **fat** (lipids). The ECS is a **complex cell**-signaling system in the human body that plays a **crucial role** in regulating various physiological processes, including appetite, metabolism, pain sensation, mood, and **immune function**. The ECS relies on endocannabinoids, which are **lipid-based neurotransmitters**.  

Endocannabinoids are **synthesized from lipids** (fats) in cell membranes, and they **bind** to cannabinoid receptors throughout the body. These receptors are found in various tissues, including the brain, nervous system, immune cells, and **adipose (fat) tissue**.  

One of the well-known endocannabinoids is `anandamide`, which is derived from arachidonic acid, a **type** of **fatty acid.** Additionally, the cannabinoid receptors themselves are **embedded** in cell membranes, which **consist** of **lipid bilayers**.  

So, in essence, the endocannabinoid system has connections to lipids and **relies on fats** for the **synthesis** of endocannabinoids and **proper functioning**.  

**Dietary fats** are essential for overall health. Fats, also known as lipids, are a **crucial macronutrient** that serves several important functions in the body. Here are some reasons why **dietary fats** are necessary :  

* **Energy Source**: Fats are a concentrated source of calories, providing energy for various bodily functions and physical activities.
* **Cell Membrane Structure**: Fats are a **key component** of cell membranes, helping to maintain cell structure and function.
* **Vitamin Absorption**: Certain vitamins, such as vitamins A, D, E, and K, are fat-soluble, meaning they require dietary fats for absorption. These vitamins are essential for various bodily processes.
* **Brain Health**: The brain is composed largely of fats, and dietary fats are crucial for brain development and cognitive function.
* **Hormone Production**: Fats are necessary for the synthesis of hormones, including sex hormones like estrogen and testosterone.
* **Protection**: Fat stores in the body act as insulation and provide protection for organs.

# How cigarette makers sold food (2023)

* [source](https://href.li/?https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/09/19/addiction-foods-hyperpalatable-tobacco/) | [mirror](https://www.filecrypt.cc/Container/ACFD081595.html)  

For decades, tobacco companies **hooked** people on cigarettes by making their products more **addictive**. Now, a new study suggests that tobacco companies may have used a **similar strategy** to hook people on **processed foods**.  

In the 1980s, tobacco giants [Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds](https://www.pipiscrew.com/threads/british-american-tobacco.42892/) acquired the **major food** companies 
* Kraft
* General Foods 
* Nabisco  

allowing tobacco firms to **dominate America food supply** and reap billions in sales from popular brands such as Oreo cookies, Kraft Macaroni & Cheese and Lunchables.  

By the 2000s, the tobacco giants spun off their food companies and largely exited the food industry — but not before leaving a **lasting legacy** on the foods that **we eat**.  

The new research, published in the [journal Addiction](https://doi.org/10.1111/add.16332), focuses on the rise of `hyper-palatable` foods, which contain potent combinations of fat, sodium, sugar and other additives that can **drive** people to **crave** and overeat them. The `Addiction study` found that in the decades when the tobacco giants **owned** the world leading food companies, the foods that they sold were far more likely to be **hyper-palatable** than similar foods **not owned by** tobacco companies.  

In the past 30 years, `hyper-palatable` foods have **spread rapidly** into the **food supply**, coinciding with a surge in obesity and [diet-related diseases](http://doi.org/10.5888/pcd14.160287). In America, the steepest increase in the prevalence of hyper-palatable foods [occurred](https://doi.org/10.1017/s1368980022001227) between **1988 and 2001**, the era when Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds owned the world leading food companies.  

Even though the **tobacco companies no longer own** these food brands, researchers say the findings matter because many of the **ultra-processed foods** that we eat today were engineered by an industry that wrote the **playbook** on products that are `highly-palatable`, addictive and appealing to `children`.  

> We found that tobacco companies **selectively disseminated** hyper-palatable foods into the food supply  
>
> It’s important for people to **understand** where these foods came from and who was **responsible** for putting them into our food system in a way that **saturates the environment**.  

said [Tera Fazzino](https://fazzinolab.ku.edu/people/tera-fazzino), the lead author of the new study and an assistant professor in the department of **psychology** at the **University of Kansas**.
