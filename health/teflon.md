`Teflon` was first developed in the 1930s by a scientist named Roy Plunkett while working for the **DuPont** company. At the time, Teflon was primarily used as a **lubricant** and as a material for making **seals** in various industrial applications.   

However, it was later discovered (1950s) that Teflon had **non-stick** properties and could be used to create a non-stick **coating** for cookware. This was a **significant breakthrough** (1960s) in the field of **cookware** and made cooking with Teflon-coated pans much more convenient and efficient. Teflon quickly became **popular** among consumers due to its non-stick properties and its ability to make cooking and cleaning easier and the population develop `cancer`.  

for reference, nowadays statistics :
* In 2020, an estimated **1,806,590 new cases** of cancer will be diagnosed **only in US**. [soure](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/statistics)
* Almost **10 Million people** world wide, die from cancer annually. [source](https://ourworldindata.org/cancer)

It's important to remember that Teflon was developed and marketed decades ago, nowadays, with more knowledge and studies, the **concerns** have been **raised** and it's important to be aware of the potential risks and take precautions when using Teflon-coated cookware, such as using them on low to medium heat and avoiding preheating empty pans or better not using it at all.

* **In December 2011**, the scientists began to release their findings: there was a `probable link` between `PFOA` and kidney cancer, testicular cancer, thyroid disease, high cholesterol, pre-eclampsia and ulcerative colitis and imagine how many other as they 'own' the scientists.

`PFOA` (perfluorooctanoic acid) and `PTFE` (polytetrafluoroethylene) are both fluoropolymers, but they are used for different purposes and have different properties.

`PFOA` is a chemical compound that is used as a processing aid in the production of some types of fluoropolymers, including Teflon (PTFE). It is not used as a coating on cookware, but it is used in the **manufacturing process** to make some types of non-stick coating, such as Teflon. PFOA is considered as a persistent organic **pollutant** due to its potential **health** and environmental effects, and it has been **phased out** of use by many manufacturers.  

`PTFE`, on the other hand, is the chemical compound that is used to **make** `Teflon`, a brand of non-stick **coating**. PTFE is a synthetic fluoropolymer that is **applied** to the **surface** of cookware to create a non-stick coating. Is controversial material due to the potential health risks associated with **inhaling fumes** produced when the Teflon coated pans are overheated.  

`PFOA` and `PFOS` are members of a chemical group called per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (aka `PFAS`).

There are several blood tests that can detect the presence of heavy metals and in the body, including:  
* Blood lead levels
* Blood mercury levels
* Blood cadmium levels
* Blood arsenic levels
* Blood aluminum levels
* Blood nickel levels

and also blood tests, for 'cookware' derived :
* PFOA
* PFOS 
* PFAS  

`PFOA` can be measured in blood for years after exposure. PFOA levels **decline** in blood naturally by about half every 2-4 years, assuming there is no additional exposure. [source](https://www.health.ny.gov/environmental/investigations/hoosick/docs/pfoa_blood_sampling_q_and_a_9_2_16.pdf)

Thank you for contacting the Tefal helpline.

The `Tefal`/T-fal non-stick surface is a technical layer made of a polymer labeled `PTFE` (poly-tetra-fluoro-ethylene). It is PTFE that gives the dishes **non-stick** properties. European and American public health agencies (ANSES, EFSA, FDA) have proven that `PTFE` is an inert substance that does **not cause** chemical reactions when in contact with food, water and household cleaning products. It does not present any danger if **swallowed**. These public health agencies have also certified the safety of nonstick PTFE cookware. PTFE is **so harmless** from a health point of view that it is often used in the healthcare industry for the surface treatment of pacemakers and miniature tubes replacing arteries. This material is also used in surgical interventions, when it helps patients with serious kidney diseases. Some joint replacements are also provided with a surface layer of `PTFE`.

Pans of the **Tefal Unlimited** series are made of aluminum with **titanium admixture**. Their surface guarantees maximum non-stickiness and durability.
