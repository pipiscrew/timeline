For spaces more than 25m2 you need **gas heater** otherwise you have to double the **electrical convectors**.  

You can `measure` the gas bottle with :
 * **Float Gauge** : This is a simple device that uses a float that rises and falls with the liquid level. It typically has a **dial that indicates** the level of propane in the tank. Not good idea with this multiple connections. [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8i8KEFBX98Y)
 * **Ultrasonic Level Sensor** : These sensors use **ultrasonic waves** to measure the distance to the liquid surface. They can provide **accurate readings** and are suitable for various tank sizes. [UT345C](https://meters.uni-trend.com/product/ut345c/)
